## Sam's Take:

Maybe I’m in a good mood because I finally freed myself from the Red Dead Redemption 2: Epilogue Part 2, but I was absolutely thrilled by Bizzare Trip. The game opens with an all time terrible title screen (see above) while Baja Blastin’ 9 billion decibels worth of discount Hotline Miami OST. So right away I’m in a great mood and press New Game. There’s a quick lore dump about you going to visit your hometown until something happened, then the game starts proper. At first it looks like a simple infinite runner where you dodge cars:

But it doesn’t take long to realize that something is off here. Why is there a UFO up ahead? What do the coins on the side of the road do? Why is my car accelerating towards the spaceship at mach 12? Most importantly, why is the best way to make it to the end of level just to let go of the keyboard and stay in between lanes where cars never spawn? 

As I’m trying to figure out the answers to these questions, ignoring whatever Miku-core music is blaring into my headphones, another spaceship comes by and shoots lasers down the middle of the road. They do not harm me. The ship flies away. The level, now completed, fades to black.

It’s then that we get to the true lore of the game, that they were invading when I was in the middle trip.

I assumed the game would either be over or lead to the same level but faster, but instead there’s a whole bunch of text explaining how we help a blue haired woman who’s trapped in her car.

She asks to ride with us, we agree. The vibe is ultra-mysterious.

Then they hit us with THE UPGRADE SCREEN. Not only is the synthwave somehow 4 times louder than ever before, but the fire smoke is bubblin’ and the buttons are all a different kind of baffling.

Let’s start with upgrade, for it’s the simplest. It does nothing. Excellent start. Main menu takes you back to the start of the game without giving you the option to go back. Press this and you must beat the first level again (AKA press zero buttons for roughly 45 seconds). Settings brings you to 90% purple dead space and 10 settings-based dead space.

Finally, Next Stage:

Incredible. On top of it all, it wasn’t until being auto-corrected while typing this review that I realized they spelled “bizarre” wrong in the title.

There are zero things correct about this game. It’s perfect. The only thing wrong with it was that it came too late to make it into my [Red Dead Redemption/Wild West Postal joke retrospective video](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-350){:target="_blank"}. Other than that, full marks across the board.

## Skeeter's Take:

At first, I was worried that I wouldn’t have anything to say about Bizzare Trip. Thankfully, there is a “Help” button on the Main Screen.

The correct controls are actually “a” and “d” - I even launched the game again to confirm this and pressing “b” does as much as the Upgrade button. 

This whole thing is a beautiful car wreck. 

**Recommend: Little Red Corvette**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Baby, you're much too fast**

Edit: I left the game running after I confirmed the “b” key did nothing, and turns out you can drive all the way to the side of the road and never lose:
