**Recommend: No. Tetris theme still goes hard.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Click any to redo**

**Time Played: 9.5 seconds**

## Sam's Take:

Honestly the choice to have black text with a highlighter-yellow shadow on a pastel-blue background is such an incredibly based aesthetic choice that I kind of respect this game.

This game has an actual goal and tells you how well you did in achieving that goal, which is more than I can say for the last three games we’ve played.

Congrats Type the Alphabet, you receive the lofty title of “a game”.

**Recommend: Umm... do you feel like typing the alphabet?** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: If I get Covid again, we’ll review this again. That’s how you’ll know%**

**Time Played: 17 Seconds**
