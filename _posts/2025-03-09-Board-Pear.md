## Skeeter's Take:

There’s a line I have to tread when I say “Bored Pear appears to be made by some kid learning flash”. It’s like flipping a coin. On one side, there’s a kid who made this flash animation, and I admire that. On the other side, there’s an adult who worked hard on this animation and I mistakenly assumed they were a child. 

A pear is bored. An apple makes fun of the pear until it gets annoyed and yells at the apple. The apple runs of sad, then yells something else annoying and the animation ends. It’s Veggie Tales coded with Annoying Orange humor:

What concept?! What are you talking about??? A pear and apple talk in weird voices and it makes no sense. One laughs, the other threatens to kill him... what concept? I’m all for being positive in these comments but literally, what do you mean?! What concept? What would a bad execution be? WHAT. DO. THEY. MEAN?!?!!?!?!?!?!?

These animations are nothing and their comments are just words. My mind is mush.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: Please let this game jam end**
