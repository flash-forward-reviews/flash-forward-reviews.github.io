## Skeeter's Take:

The Majora’s Mask Treasure Chest Game is frustrating, to say the least. 

A treasure chest appears at the end of a checkered grid. There is a hidden maze within the grid. Each section of the grid will pop up and block progress when the player gets close to it. The goal is to reach the treasure chest before the 45 seconds are up. The chest will give different rewards depending on what form Link is in. For human Link, the reward is 50 rupees. The game cost 20 rupees. Essentially, you can earn a total of 30 rupees from this game early (Deku Scrub form only gives deku nuts as a reward.). However, this really doesn’t feel worth it as the treasure chest game feels so random. Either you go down the correct path and get to the treasure chest, or you go down the incorrect path and have to spend the entire time backtracking and lose. Most of the time it feels like a total crap shoot. 

Young me was a big fan of this mini-game, though. I spent a lot of time here as a kid. I don’t really want to say why…

**Recommend: Only once you reach Goron transformation and can get the heart container piece**

**Replay Percentage Chance: I am not sure how to answer this**

**Time Played: 10 minutes**

## Sam's Take:

It seems like you get it, am being weird? Haha, no... nah I’m just in my own head about it. Seems like other people get it.

I actually don’t like how much they get it.
