## Sam's Take:

One thing I somehow didn’t even touch on in our review yesterday were the incredible vistas in RDR2. Obviously they had to step up their game for the 3rd installment and boy did they deliver! Just look at those photo-realistic clouds!

One of the only things that has aged a tiny bit graphically in RDR2 were the character faces, but of course the 3 used all the latest motion capture technology to really let the actors’ facial performances shine through.

It’s not all good though. Rockstar made the baffling decision to make the entire game a long obstacle course. I’m glad they’re finally experimenting again instead of making GTA in different settings over and over, but I don’t think their talents lie in platforming.

The character writing has been simplified to just floating text. There’s a character introduced about halfway into the game named Jeff the Killer. I’m assuming once the game leaves early access he’ll have a quest assigned to him or something, but right now he just stands in a red box and doesn’t move.

One entire section is just a long red maze? I assume it’s red for Red Dead, so actually that’s pretty good.

Like I said, this game is in early access so maybe hunting and poker will get added in later, but as it stands I’m a little worried about the direction Rockstar have gone with the third entry in their prestige cowboy series. We’ll hold off final judgement until the game’s full release, but color me sceptical right now.

## Skeeter's Take:

Guys, holy cow, Red Dead Redemption 3 just dropped! It’s live exclusively in Roblox right now!

Dutch and the gang are back for another trip to Tahiti. This time, they’ve made some new friends along the way - thuih111 and skeeteronthemic!

I can’t wait to find out what an obby is!

Just some cowboys around the good ol’ camp! 

Even Pearson and his iconic stew are here:

Well, I was already to head out on my great cowboy western adventure with the gang when the “obby” revealed itself to me. Obby? Yeah, turns out that wasn’t a typo of “Lobby”. Instead, it most likely stands for “Obstacle Course”

And what a painful experience this obstacle course was. I spent way too long dying over and over again because I’m an old man and the controls on Roblox are weird and clunky and I hate them and I’m not bad at games I promise. 

This pain was only made worse by such things as adding Jeff the Killer:
