## Skeeter's Take:

Welcome to the beautiful Aspen Mountain Ski Resort nestled in lovely Colorado - a popular destination for any ski-centric vacation!

Unfortunately, you are Jesus and protecting the goodwill of humanity is a full time job. While you initially flew down to Aspen to unwind after a long, sweaty day of forgiving humanities sins, the lord demon of the underworld, Satan, had other plans. 
Satan, after all, is a notorious snowball fighter - probably what he‚Äôs best known for! And on this sunny day in Aspen, he decided to ruin your whole vacation by throwing endless heaping mass orbs of snow at you.

Satan is a most relentless evil, and he will not stop until at least one mortal person has had their spirit claimed. In a wonderful allegory for the battle of Good and Evil, you are caught in a space of limbo, an endless back and forth tug o‚Äô war of snowballs and skiers lives, and you are but the humble Holy rope. 

You have no choice but to take on the responsibility. 
After all, it‚Äôs part of the contract you signed when you were hammered into that crucifixion cross: 

‚ÄúJesus Saves‚Äù

## Sam's Take:

I unfortunately have to announce that I kinda like this one. The snowballs pile up pretty quickly and making the split second decision of trying to push a snowball back behind the ball-barricade you created, or attempting to headbutt it into the stratosphere is mildly engaging.

There are no bells and whistles on this game. Hell, there‚Äôs not even a game over screen, but it was good enough for me to make an actual (unsuccessful) attempt at a high score. Make this four-player split screen, turn the skiers into koopas and Jesus into Mario‚Äôs gang, and you have a fairly solid Mario Party minigame.


**Recommend: Sure, but just one game, don‚Äôt go too hard** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 1.11%**
