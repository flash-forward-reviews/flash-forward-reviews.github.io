## Sam's Take:

It’s Five Nights at Freddy’s, except with memes on the walls and jpgs of the dev’s friends instead of the animatronics.

That’s really it. It’s a little hard to keep the security screen up (it seems to be triggered by hovering over the bottom of the screen, but it always took me two or three tries), but other than that, it’s a pretty faithful recreation. I especially like that the metal doors have been replaced with regular house doors:

For me the intro messages were too long and self indulgent, and the memes weren’t funny, but if I was a kid in this friend group, I’d be howlin’. This is obviously stupid and not made for me, but it is both shockingly functional and a lot of work for a little joke with your friends. You don’t need to play it, but I bet the included friend group had a blast with this. I can’t be against kids makin’ stuff.

**Recommend: I recommend it if your likeness is in this game.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 7 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

I don’t know how Sam only played 7 minutes when the intro monologue is 40 minutes. 

My boss talked so long, I lost 41% power the first night!

Now I’m going to be expected to make that time up with productivity. At least my boss hung some solid motivation on the wall.

**Recommend: Nice job, kid. Runs better than some games we play.** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 41 minutes**
