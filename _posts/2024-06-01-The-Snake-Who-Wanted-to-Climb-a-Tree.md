## Sam's Take:

Pretty simple game today, you drag your mouse back and let go to fling the snake into a branch. You climb up from branch to branch until you get all the way up the tree and win the game.

This is another game made for a 48 hour game jam, and the art and animation are honestly pretty impressive for that amount of time. I also like that the game starts with this little asshole bird basically telling you to fuck right off:

The game’s music and art are a little disgustingly twee for my tastes, but it was made for the “wholesome game jam” so it’s on brand I guess. It’s fine. This game is the most fine. There’s never been a game more fine than this. If I were a more diligent reviewer, I would have played another more interesting game to talk about, but we’re doing this 365 times. I think getting the full spectrum of what’s out there is important, even if some of the games are just... there.

This isn’t some unfunny shitpost, this isn’t a cash-grab of any kind, it’s just someone seriously trying to make something. We encourage that here at Flash Forward Reviews. This is a game someone made in 48 hours. They did an okay job, but it isn’t very interesting. I made a review about it in 15 minutes, it too was not very interesting, but we did it and now it’s there on the internet.

## Skeeter's Take:

Hey guys, I’m back from a wedding and drunk. I made it to the first birds nest and I can wholeheartedly say I have no desire to continue playing. Is it the alcohol? Who knows, but I didn’t have fun slinging my snake up a tree. I don’t care about this snake. Why should I care about this snake? I shouldn’t. There’s no reason. The game doesn’t give you a reason and we are collectively teetering on the brink of WWIII so what does it matter if someone makes a simple snake jumping game? It doesn’t. Why does it matter if I review this game? It doesn’t. This review is shit. All my reviews are shit. As Barry McGuire once said, can’t you see, we are on the Eve of Destruction.
Man, I have ingested too much alcohol to be putting these drunk thoughts out into the internet just willy nilly. 
Nothing matters. We all die. Make your own fun, but the best way to do that would be to not play snake jump ravioli special. 

I sure hope I edit this later, because YEESH.
