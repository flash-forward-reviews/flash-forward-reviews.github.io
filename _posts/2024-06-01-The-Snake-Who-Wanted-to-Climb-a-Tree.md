## Sam's Take:

Pretty simple game today, you drag your mouse back and let go to fling the snake into a branch. You climb up from branch to branch until you get all the way up the tree and win the game.

This is another game made for a 48 hour game jam, and the art and animation are honestly pretty impressive for that amount of time. I also like that the game starts with this little asshole bird basically telling you to fuck right off:

The game’s music and art are a little disgustingly twee for my tastes, but it was made for the “wholesome game jam” so it’s on brand I guess. It’s fine. This game is the most fine. There’s never been a game more fine than this. If I were a more diligent reviewer, I would have played another more interesting game to talk about, but we’re doing this 365 times. I think getting the full spectrum of what’s out there is important, even if some of the games are just... there.

This isn’t some unfunny shitpost, this isn’t a cash-grab of any kind, it’s just someone seriously trying to make something. We encourage that here at Flash Forward Reviews. This is a game someone made in 48 hours. They did an okay job, but it isn’t very interesting. I made a review about it in 15 minutes, it too was not very interesting, but we did it and now it’s there on the internet.

## Skeeter's Take:

Skeeter had to meet with FAMILY and will write his review LATER. We should sue him.
