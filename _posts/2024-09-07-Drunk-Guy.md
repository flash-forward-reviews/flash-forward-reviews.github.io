## Skeeter's Take:

First off, I didn’t really have to play this since I already experienced being Drunk Guy last night - complete with the glowing walkways and the falling eternally into the void:

I also shared something with the creator of the title menu for this game, because they too must have been drunk when they created this:

## Sam's Take:

FUCK DRUNK GUY

FUCK IT TO HELL

I’ve never been so mad in my damn life. The goal of Drunk Guy is to walk down a series of platforms that lead to a bathroom, but the controls randomly change, forcing your protagonist to drift left or right. First of all, submitting a game for a jam called “Ludum Dare” where you are drunk and need to make it to the bathroom is so embarrassingly collegiate that I’m shocked you don’t walk by a fucking beer pong table. OH WAIT!

Second, the layout changes every time you play, but none of the layouts are good. Somehow every one of them has some insane jump, or a long stretch of impossibly thin floorspace that sent me back to the start. You restart ten times until you get a good layout, only to fall because your guy decided to make a sharp right turn in mid-air without your permission. I kept playing Drunk Guy not because it was good, but because I couldn’t let it win. I couldn’t let this dogshit dub-step steeped trash heap get the better of me. Eventually I did reach the bathroom.

Imagine being drunk and going to the bathroom then thinking “I should make a game about this”! That’d be so real and funny!

Imagine being that kind of person.

Fucking embarrassing.
