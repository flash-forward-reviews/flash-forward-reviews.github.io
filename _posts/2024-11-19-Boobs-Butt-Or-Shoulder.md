## Skeeter's Take:

I got the only question that mattered right:

It’s impressive that someone took the time to record a voice clip for every question. Even if the quips consist of phrases like “Smack it Smack it oh yes” and “Squeeze em, slop em, move em around”.

I got 20/30. I don’t know what that says about me. 

I do know one thing though - I can write 730 reviews and not one of them will be as good as this one:

DolphLOL - you are my idol. 

**Recommend: Boobs**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Butt**

**Time Played: Shoulder** 

## Sam's Take:

I have to be very careful about how I compliment this game. It’s just a quiz show where you are shown part of a body and have to correctly guess if it is boobs, butt, or shoulder. If you get it right, the annoncer compliments you, if you get it wrong, the annoncer usually says that you’re gay. There’s not much else here going on. While playing it I said “this has to be from the early 2000s”, and as foretold:

So look, there is no reason to play this now. However, after playing that stupid fucking coconut game yesterday, and all the trash we’ve waded through in our *(does math, has quick existential crisis)* 550+ game reviews, it would be dishonest of me to not admit that if I played this when I was *(does math, has quick existential crisis)* 13 years old in 2005... I would have laughed at this.

That is NOT a recommendation, I sucked so hard when I was 13. You think I hate myself now? Well there’s not a single person on this planet I hate more than 13 year old Sam. That kid was a PIECE OF SHIT! Never tell a kid that he’s smart and funny at 13 everyone, we don’t need that ego going around. Jesus fucking God.

What was I talking about? Oh yea, Boobs, Butt, or Shoulder.

Yea I didn’t like it.

I would have.

But I don’t now.

...

I don’t actually hate myself btw. I’ve worked on that a lot.

...

How many more reviews are left? *(does math, has quick existential crisis)*

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 3 Minutes**
