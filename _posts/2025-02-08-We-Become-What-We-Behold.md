## Sam's Take: 

I’ve made this warning before, but it’s actually been a while since it’s happened, so I’ll make it again. I’m about to criticize this game a bit, but only because it’s a pretty real game that has something to say, and therefore I have something tangible to criticize. This isn’t a [Baby Shooter](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-5){:target="_blank"} scenario where I’m criticizing it existing, or being mega low effort, WBWWB has something to say, it says it, and I get to interpret that. This is a real game, and that already puts it above a lot of recent games, so before I go saying some negative things, just know that it’s on an incomparably higher level than [Frog vs. Mural Girl](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-283){:target="_blank"}.

WBWWB is a simple short little idea. People walk around a little grassy area with a TV in the middle. You try to take a picture of interesting things happening, people see it on the TV and it changes their behavior.

If this looks interesting to you go play it now. It’s five minutes long, simple, in-browser, and pretty good. I’m going to spoil the whole game now. You have been warned.

The game gets increasingly more violent as it goes on. You take a picture of a circle yelling at a square, get the headline circles hate squares, a square sees it, gets upset, yells at a circle, take a picture of that, etc. It all culminates in an all out war where everyone kills everyone else. Media cycles influence behaviors that the media then reports on. A simple thesis displayed competently.

My main issue is that the game is sometimes direct in a way that detracts from what the game is attempting to accomplish. For example, when fighting starts to break out, you have the option of photographing some more peaceful moments, but the game doesn’t let you:

Mechanically it’s trying to prove the existence of negative media cycles through gameplay, but at this point it’s just telling me that violence goes viral. This doesn’t show me that violence goes viral in a natural way, it’s just one game dev telling me it does, and so it doesn’t have the same impact. It’s a sticking point because I feel like there is a way to do this naturally. There has to be some way where the player has greater control of the headlines and what pictures they are taking. I’m not sure what the solution is, but this feels like the blueprint to a great idea, which is pretty good for a game made in two months. The ending is also a bit annoying, with each picture zooming out to reveal someone playing the game on a laptop. I don’t think this game is smart or interesting enough to be going for big-swing meta commentary on that level, but I’ll always take a swing and a miss over being boring.

It’s a good idea, and the code is completely open to use and copy on his page, so if you have the great idea to make this whole media cycle game work in a more natural fluid way, go ham. Not a great game, but it’s putting that work in towards the next great game, and if Flash Forward doesn’t celebrate the stepping stones to greatness, then why do we even bother looking at free 2-month solo dev games?
