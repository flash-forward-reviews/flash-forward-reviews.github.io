## Skeeter's Take:

We are nearing the end of this project, and yet I still find myself scrolling through the new section of games instead of trying to put effort forward on one of the games we said we would replay. 

Just an observation. Turns out a year of this really takes some of the steam out of me. 

Anyway, We have Fast Fish today. It’s a (wild) animal racing game, and despite the name, you can select from three animals, only one of them being a fish:

Not enough variety for you? Don’t worry, there are also FOUR different stages!!!

Fall, Summer, August, Winter! 

You run your awkward animal around the track three times and the game ends.

There is a leaderboard, and I made my name “iambetterthansam” despite knowing full well he’s about to beat my time on his first run and then make fun of me in this review.

**Recommend: It’s no Paul Bird**

**Replay Percentage Chance: ERROR ERROR ERROR**

**Time Played: 9 minutes**

I didn’t read Skeeter’s review before playing, and then saw this on the leaderboard and new...

God damn it.

**Recommend: I actually think the visuals and animal hyperspeed make this game legitimately funny.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Like for real you should actually play this one.**

**Time Played:**
