## Skeeter's Take:

Dota2Guessr is pretty basic. The player can select from 3 different game modes. 

1. Map Guesser - Geo-Guesser type game where you have to find the location on the Dota 2 map based on the first person view of a location from it. This is confounding because while you can guess the side of the map based on color scheme and decorations, it’s pretty difficult knowing the exact spot since when you are playing Dota, it’s all viewed from the Isometric Top Down view, not a 3rd/1st person view. This does add a bit of challenge, surprisingly. The game is also not forgiving at all. I clicked on a spot in the Dire fountain, and it told me the actual spot was across the very small fountain on the opposite side, and gave me no points.
2. Arteezy Cliffs - Geo-Guesser type game where you try to find the cliffs Arteezy has been cliffed on. Pretty funny idea (you can even watch the clips once you’ve guessed) but a lot of the cliffs and positions have changed with the map over the years, so I don’t know how accurate it is (not that that matters much). 
3. Recipe Guesser - Guess item recipes from Dota 2. Usually this would be easy for someone who has an embarrassing amount of hours into Dota 2:

However, many of the recipes are also outdated (item recipes change with new patches all the time) so it made this quite challenging as well as I had to try to remember how these items were built a few patches back. 

And that’s kind of it! To be honest, I find these kinds of “quiz” games difficult to write about other than explaining what it is. It’s a quiz! It’s higher effort than something like “what family guy character are you” but not something I want to write home about or recommend people play. 
These quiz games remind me of taking college courses where they’d give you mandatory quizzes online and those quizzes worked about half the time they were supposed to. I think the idea of a video game Geo-Guesser is actually kind of fun, though Dota is an odd choice for a Geo-Guesser game. The Geo-Guesser format really lends itself better to a GTA or Red Dead open world game. It’s an odd choice for a small map that is the only map you play on. But hey, at least it’s not Disney Speedstorm (Yes, I’m still bitter).

**Recommend:  Naw. Even if you are a Dota player, you could probably find an updated version of this kind of game somewhere else.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 5%**

**Time Played: 10 minutes.** 

## Sam's Take:

This really doesn’t suck. I had a fun time trying to figure out where I was based on jungle camps. The recipes are outdated unfortunately, but the recipe guessing used to be a feature in the Dota 2 client while you were queuing for games. The Map Guesser would be kinda sweet on the Dota 2 main page. I’d absolutely mess with it while queuing up for a game.

This version obviously will not stay updated, and I don’t see myself playing this again anytime soon, but if I worked on the Dota 2 dev team, I’d at least bring this up in a meeting.

**Recommend: No, but a nice no.** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 3%**

**Time Played: 2 Minutes**
