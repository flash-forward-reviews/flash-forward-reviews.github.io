## Skeeter's Take:

Sam had to defend his title in Blaster Meltdown since some rando beat him out. He sent me a video at 4am yesterday of his run, so you know he was taking this seriously. 

Unfortunately for Sam, I too managed a sub 100 time:

**Recommend: Yeah, despite my lack of improvement.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Depends on if someone beats Sam’s score**

**Time Played: Sub 100 seconds**

## Sam's Take:

Okay Blaster Meltdown is actually sick as fuck. I’ve been working to keep my record and improve my time. Planning my route to use as much of the speed coolant as possible, grabbing a coolant backpack when I am one shot away from dying? Immaculate.

If you don’t remember, Blaster Meltdown has a mechanic where you lose health when shooting, but your health is always regenerating. I mentioned in my review that it can lead to safe, slow, boring gameplay, but now spending more time speedrunning it... it’s kinda cracked guys.

It’s just short enough to really get into the minutia of speed. Killing while moving, jumping up stairs, run past enemies to line them up while shooting backwards, there is some nuance for getting through every room in this game. I made Skeeter review it again just so I could brag about my sub-100:

I’m the Blaster Meltdown GOD. Don’t FUCK with me!

**Recommend: 100** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 100%**

**Time Played: 100 Seconds**
