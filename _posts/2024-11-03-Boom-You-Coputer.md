## Skeeter's Take:

Boom you coputer exists with that sole goal in mind - to overload your coputer and possibly the senses.

A million Scratch the Cats flash on screen, each making an annoying meow-woop sound. There is a “cat makes move” counter, the ambiguity of it intrigues me. Cats phase quickly in and out of existence. Their cries of pain give me tinnitus. I made it to 1004 cat makes move before I shut it down. 

Don’t play this game if you:

- Have a lower end computer (I’m worried it might actually Boom you coputer) 
- Have epilepsy 
- Enjoy the ability to hear without a persistent ring
- Are alive

**Replay Percentage Chance: no**

**Time Played: 30 seconds or however long it took to get to 1000 cat makes move**
