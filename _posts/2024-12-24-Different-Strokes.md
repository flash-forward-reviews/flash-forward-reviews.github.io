## Sam's Take:

Skeeter is out of town, so I will be updating his review when he returns.

This is just a fun little museum where anyone can find an empty canvas if they walk around for long enough and draw on it. After that, it is added to the collection and anyone that walks by can vote it up or down (I assume these votes decide which paintings get moved closer to the front? I’m not totally sure how that works). The twist is that if an artist uploaded a new painting, then a second artist can walk by and modify it however they want. Once the modification is complete, no one else is allowed to edit the painting, that second rendition is the final piece.

There were tons of sick ‘paintings’ and I ran through for about five minutes without seeing anything horribly offensive, so the mods for this game must be working overtime. The modifications range from re-shaping the entire painting to just adding some detail work. The whole process makes the museum feel alive and flowing. In the end it’s just an art gallery with a gimmick, but it’s a very low stakes one. So low stakes that I even made one of my own:

**Recommend: Hell yea**

**Time Played: 5 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

This game is cool and all, but it wouldn't let me save the penises I drew on other people's artwork.

Which is probably all for the better. I didn't get the opportunity to ruin some great artworks:

I HOPE THIS HURTS
