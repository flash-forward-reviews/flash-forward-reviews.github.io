## Skeeter's Take:

Toad Road is a cute little game about a toad that’s late to a party and decides to take a shortcut. The game plays similar to [Happy Wheels](https://web.archive.org/web/20180817154659/http://postpostproduction.com/flash-in-the-pan/happy-wheels/){:target="_blank"} where the player needs to navigate their vehicle over obstacles in the road. The obstacles here being mounds of dirt:

Drive over the mounds and make it to the party. I really liked the victory screen for winning:

It’s cute. The music is fun. It just doesn’t have enough “oomph” to get it over the recommend line for me. 

**Recommend: Nah**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 62 seconds**

## Sam's Take:

Obviously I have to brag about beating Skeeters score. It’s an old bit, but with a month left to go on these reviews I can’t back down from it now:

This is the okayist game we’ve ever played for this site. It works. The art and music are cute and fun. I beat it, I was satisfied that I beat it. I will never think about it again. Good reminder of the many options between shitpost and real-game.

**Recommend: Neutral**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 2 Minutes**
