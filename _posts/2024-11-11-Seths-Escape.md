## Sam's Take:

Some fucker I don’t know has a YouTube channel and made a game about getting stuck in a toilet then his evil alter-ego takes over the YouTube channel. You play his pet snail set off on a platformer quest to save him.

The big twist of this game is that instead of jumping on top of enemies to kill them, you hit them from underneath. It’s actually kind of fun to wait until they jump over you to bob em. There’s some enemies you have to lure by jumping then sneaking under, it’s not bad.

The game is full of memes I don’t understand, but if you’re a fan of their YouTube channel you probably thought it was hilarious. Maybe. The last boss throws flavored sprite at you? Not sure about that. Also you jump on YouTube thumbnails to bonk the guy. I don’t get it, but someone probably does!

It’s not made for me, but I still beat it... so good job I guess. It’s fine. You did it. Great! Nice job. Last boss was kind of hard and actually almost fun. Nice! Wow! Okay!

2.2M subscribers with 843 videos is very impressive. It doesn’t quite hold a candle to my counts:

I like the pink snail mascot. I’ve always liked the idea of a mascot. My last project used a shitty MSpaint skull. 
It gets a little confusing though, since there’s the snail, then there’s also this person.

Is this person the snail? They've got a snail T-Shirt on. Are they just a fan of the snail? Why is the snail involved at all if this is the person?  Why is there a more well drawn anime version of thumbs up, pink hair, sunglasses in the banner? Can they Animorph into a snail? That’d be pretty rad!
Lots of questions. None of them answered. The branding waters stay muddied.

A bit too clickbaity for my tastes. I guess you have to do what you can to stand out on YouTube these days by making a clickbait thumbnail that looks like every other one. The white backgrounds and bold black text helps them stand out from most of the other sleaze we see these days:

There’s something I really dislike about “the Arrow”

{% include figure.html image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/refs/heads/main/img/seth10.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

Every thumbnail I see on YouTube that has some sort of arrow, I get annoyed at it. It’s not so much the arrows fault as it is the text that precedes it. It’s always the dumbest thing someone has managed to fit into 3-5 words. 

As far as text on the thumbnails go, it’s a close tie between my two favorites. Each uses a very subtle motif throughout.

And Rating things based on…

It seems like most of MVPerry’s content consists of lists, ratings, or “what does ____ say about you?” videos. It appears they also had a stint where they had their Mom and Dad guess what character’s names are. I didn’t see a Dota one, so I didn’t check any of them out. 

However, I did decide to watch “What your biggest fear says about you! (Internet Edition) 13+

{% include video.html id="TE0Z-JOKlRY" title="" %}

By which I mean I made it 1 minute and 9 seconds into this 5 ½ minute video, and mistakenly thought I had watched at least 7 minutes by then. 

This channel clearly wasn’t meant for me. Judging by the “13+” in the video title, I’m willing to wager the average age of the typical MVPerry viewer to be between 10-13. 

Also, I just don’t understand these conclusions. I don’t even want to call them jokes, because I am genuinely not sure if they are supposed to be.

Look at that!
What hell does that even mean? The more I read it, the deeper the enigma in my mind grows. A violent trap of time and mental energy spiraling me down the ever extending road to madness. I shouldn’t attempt to understand it. I cannot understand it. It is not to be understood.
