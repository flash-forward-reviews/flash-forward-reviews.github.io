## Skeeter's Take:

I only picked today’s game because I typed “228” into itch.io and saw a Dota meme as the title picture and figured it was meant to be. 

I couldn’t read the title, so I popped it into a translator and got this gibberish:

I proceeded with a little hesitation and trepidation as I didn’t like that the translator put “Fuck” and a word with the “Pedo” prefix right next to each other. I googled “Pedolia” just to be safe, and this was the first result:

Seeing as the language is being detected as Slovakian and Podolia is in Eastern Europe, I’m going to assume typo or translation error and proceed further with caution. 

Immediately I find myself staring out into a linoleum covered room with a bean man laying on a hospital bed.

Careless Whisper carelessly blares from the closed curtains to the right of me. My character, seemingly made of a sticky Gumby-like substance, can only wiggle in place a little and clip their head through the wall occasionally. 

After some jump spam, I manage to free myself from the hospital curtain prison and finally get to peek into the Careless Whisper room. What I find I have no answers for:

I check up on one of the characters laying in the hospital bed.

I really wish the nurse had closed her eyes after her passing. The blank gaze of her gigantic eyes look past me, even while I’m staring back. RIP Cat thing. I hope you have someone who will miss you.

I through the door to the next room and find a hallway full of doors and a massive “EXIT” sign on the other end of the hall. There is a Dota meme on the wall as well:

I don’t get the whole joke here, but Pugde going Mask of Madness, Shadow Blade, and Basher is a pretty funny meme. The rest of it - your guess is as good as mine. 

Since I just finished Silent Hill 2 Remake, I checked every damn door in that hallway and every damn one of them was locked and it felt like I was playing Silent Hill again. 

After I reached the end of the hall, I entered the doorway labeled “EXIT”. 
There in front of me was something amazing. 

The game had read my mind. It knew what I was thinking, how I had felt about it. It conceptualized all the complex nuances of my impression of this game into a distilled, concise three letter word:

I then ran left into the darkness. My character fell through the floor. I watched as the skybox floated away and soon all I saw was darkness. 

From darkness, I was born again. I saw myself from a new point of view. A third person point of view. It gave me some opportunity to take some edgy screenshots before I had to force quit the game:
