## Sam's Take:

Rock Paper Scissors with voice lines from Baulder’s Gate 3. It has a little animated Astarion.

I don’t have much more to say about this game other than “thank God Skeeter didn’t pick the SECOND game that comes up when you type “Astarion” into itch.io search...

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 30 Seconds**

PS. I'm pretty sure Skeeter just isn't done with his review yet, but I like that he filled in the part he already knew:
