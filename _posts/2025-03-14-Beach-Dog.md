## Skeeter's Take:

Beach Dog is a simple little game about a dog finding its owner. Walk around the 8-bit world and talk to birds and food bowls and Mister Ball!

You find your human, who seems to be a mouthpiece for the dev:

It’s a bittersweet ending. A tired, burnt out man who may not be feeling too great finds a little comfort in his dog.

## Sam's Take:

God fuckin’ damn it. Here I am, tryin to chill out and pick an easy game. Skeeter forgot yesterday, so he has a double review. I’m on vacation. I don’t want to actually review a game. I type in “beach dog”, due to the actions of my dog on the beach irl, and guess what? The game is cute and sad.

I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t want a cute game. I didn’t want to enjoy the dialogue. I didn’t want it to be just short enough to actually get through. Fuck man, why my boi gotta be all sad at the end?

I wasn’t ready for that. That wasn’t what was supposed to happen. IT SHOULDN’T EVER BE LIKE THIS. I should have gone to Newgrounds.

I hate this game because it’s kinda good. What does it mean? Who am I?

Dog.
