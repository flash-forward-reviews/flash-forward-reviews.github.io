## Skeeter's Take:

I think I prefer this over the Skyrim twisty-lock-pick mini-game.

[Edit: I do not mean the Fallout 3 twisty-lock-pick mini-game. I get some satisfaction from using the bobby pin in that. The Skyrim one is just this dumb looking rod and is nowhere near as cool.]

[Edit 2: YES IT MATTERS HERE I’VE PROVIDED A VISUAL SAMPLE AND YOU CAN’T TELL ME I’M WRONG THIS PROOF IS IRREFUTABLE!]

## Sam's Take:

I THINK YOU MEAN THE FALLOUT 3 TWIST-LOCK-PIC MINI-GAME SKEETER!!!!

[Edit: HE MEANS THE FALLOUT 3 ONE]

[Edit 2: THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS THAT IT’S A BOBBY PIN?! THIS IS GOING TO BE SO CONFUSING TO READ IN NON-GOOGLE DOC FORM!!!]

**Recommend: No**
