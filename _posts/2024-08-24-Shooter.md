## Sam's Take:

An extremely basic fps. Guys in black appear from the sky, you shoot them with a random gun that spawns in on the map. There’s a house. You can’t go in it. There’s a score. I’m not sure what it means. There’s a song. It kinda goes hard. When you download it, it says it’s version 0.1.3.

The game’s description says “get fun”. 

I hope one day it does.

## Skeeter's Take:

I misunderstood, Skeeter pre-chose these games because he’s out of town. This will be backlogged later my bad everyone!
