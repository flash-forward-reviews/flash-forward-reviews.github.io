## Sam's Take:

An extremely basic fps. Guys in black appear from the sky, you shoot them with a random gun that spawns in on the map. There’s a house. You can’t go in it. There’s a score. I’m not sure what it means. There’s a song. It kinda goes hard. When you download it, it says it’s version 0.1.3.

The game’s description says “get fun”. 

I hope one day it does.

## Skeeter's Take:

Hey, itch.io devs, 

If you advertise your game being playable  on Android, don't give us a separate download link to the mobile version and then just pack it with an .exe

You know we are looking for that sweet .apk! I'm willing to be there is a way to run an .exe from my phone, but that doesn't help me much when I'm without service. 

Sincerely, 

Concerned.
