## Skeeter's Take:

I have the faintest waft of a memory of this game - I feel like Sam and I might have played this back in the day on Flash in the Pan (our previous project). We definitely played a llama singing game that was very similar, but I can’t remember if we ever reviewed Sprunki. Regardless, Flash in the Pan is buried in the “Barely-Loads” graveyard of the Wayback machine and maybe we’ll have a renewed perspective. 

Well, I guess now's a good time to mention Sprunki simultaneously is and is not the game we are playing today, because (if you “read desc”) this is just someone else’s game with a skin/icon pack pre-installed:

So, what exactly are we reviewing today? The original game, the mod pack, or the collection presented by superstars_helper themselves? 

I only think it fair to judge the latter, but I’m curious to see what Sam ends up doing. 

So, naturally I went looking for Sprunki - I found a ton of sketchy websites with variations of “sprunki” and “Incredibox - Sprunki”. I happened to land on a website that linked to a dead itch.io page. And when searching itch.io, I opened a rabbit hole: 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/sprunki3.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

There are a million clones of this game and I’m starting to feel like this has to be a popular/famous game that somehow swerved me. 

Thankfully, there was a Sprunki wiki that had some answers:

Oh, so it was a game that was taken down at some point, so there are a million re-uploads. It’s Flappy Bird all over again.

It looks like the official port is now on Cocrea - [here's the link that claims to be the official port](https://cocrea.world/@NyankoBfLmao/Incredibox-SprunkiOFFICIALCOCREAPORT){:target="_blank"}. Though fair warning, this is what I got when I loaded the game:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/sprunki5.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

And that took me to a different singing character game that Sam and I have definitely played before: 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/sprunki6.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

So now I’m even more confused. 

Anyway, I went to one of the sketchy websites in the end to compare and contrast. See below:

Well, I guess the icons technically have more going on, so good work!

I tried to find who created BetterIcons, but without digging too deep (once a day reviews, I’m sorry), all that came up was references to this itch.io game. 

So, the question ultimately lies: Did superstars_helper create these icons and upload their mod as a package, or did they use an already existing mod? 

The wording in the Desc leads me to believe it’s an already existing mod - “And this is the whole game but i just added BetterIcons to it” heavily implies that. 

I don’t know what to do with this information. How do you review an upload of a combination of two things someone else created? If we were reviewing Sprunki, I’d say it was really fun and well done. I spent like 20 minutes dicking around and mixing together this shitty “song” (I had so much fun, tbh).

There’s a spooky themed side, which is perfect for October, the samples are interesting and fun. It’s really well made. But superstars_helper doesn’t get credit for that! That honor goes to NyankoBfLol, the original creator of Sprunki! 

And the icons are fine. I personally think they look ok and I could see them being included in a QoL mod pack. They aren’t crazy or drastically revolutionize anything. They are like “Vanilla plus” icons. I do feel like re-uploading a game just for slightly better improvements for very inconsequential icons is strange. Like, the icons could just be different colors and the game would still rule and function. They are probably one of the lesser important things in the game. It’s just a bizarre choice to dedicate that much effort and time to something so small and inconsequential, and I find that fascinating…

## Sam's Take:

Just to add a tiny bit of context, Sprunki seems to be a game inspired by [Incredibox](https://www.incredibox.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Incredibox is the game with the character Skeeter showed in one of his screenshots:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/sprunki10.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

We’ve played Incredibox before, but this cute/creepy animal version is new. I like that the whole screen changes and you get different loops when you use the creepy hat man instrument, but the music doesn’t loop as well as Incredibox. It seems like a decent fan-made game that weirdly blew up for creepypasta reasons, but I can’t pretend to understand the internet.

I don’t know what the hell is going on here, but it seems like a whole community project. I don’t understand this group, but I’m glad they're channeling their creative energy into weird horror music games. Could be worse.

**Recommend: You can give it a try** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 5.6%**

**Time Played: 10 Minutes**
