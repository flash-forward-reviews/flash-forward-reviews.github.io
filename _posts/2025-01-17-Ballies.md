## Skeeter's Take:

I came in all ready to say “Ballies? More like Balls.” and call it a day. 

But you know what? Ballies isn’t the worst thing I’ve ever seen, so it felt too mean for it to fall victim of that joke. 

Move the googly-eyed ball and either avoid the other googly-eyed balls, or bump into them if the background color matches, or place a bomb and destroy the googly-eyed balls. There are various power ups like “Machine gun” and “bomb that freezes”.

And honestly, all that is pretty “balls” as far as entertaining me goes. Ballies only barely clears the bar of interesting because of two things: 

-1. The background song has decent “Sam Doom Chaos Mod” potential. 

-2. The intro advertisement for “king.com” is one of the best things I’ve ever seen. I’m unsure of the relation between Ballies and king.com - probably another “at7games” and “Pink Alien Transplant” situation, but who cares, look at this goofy ass CGI dragon that waddles in frame from the side of the screen and breathes fire to reveal “king.com”.

**Recommend: Not playing the gameI do recommend loading and launching to watch the funny dragon.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 4 minutes**
