## Sam's Take:

Did you ever play [Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy/){:target="_blank"} and think “I wish Bennett Foddy had a deep southern accent and never stopped talking about having relations with his cousins”? Fuck dude, me neither, but here we are!

The game is frustrating on purpose, but the gameplay pales in comparison to the constantly repeating jokes with no pauses. It’s a barrage of un-comedy so strong that I feel the developer should be arrested. They’ve certainly caused more harm than anyone in possession of weed.

**Recommend: Maybe my strongest “no” to date.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Negative A Billion Percent**

**Time Played: 17 Lifetimes** 

## Skeeter's Take:

This is, in my opinion, the only acceptable settings to play “scaling a mountain using the second amendment”

You’re welcome. 

I can’t emphasize enough how annoying the narrator’s incessant quips are. It’s constant, and had me sitting in disbelief instead of actually playing the game. 

I did eventually play the game, and it’s exactly like that potted naked man sledge hammer game. I haven’t played the sledge hammer game, and I think “scaling a mountain using the second amendment” turned me off from ever trying it. 

**Recommend: No thanks**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 15 minutes**
