## Skeeter's Take:

I only picked today’s game because I wanted to see Sam rage at Scratch the Cat again. This appears to be an online-only game where you play tag as Scratch the Cat with other players. I did not have any other players, so I loaded into an empty lobby, wiggled the mobile game on-screen joystick around, and closed it. 

I think it’s important to remember:

I’m assuming the online function works, and that’s pretty impressive, so nice job, kid! 

The description is a little odd…

But still, we should probably keep in mind:

While there is no doubt that this is a fun game

We need to consider the following:

Because, damn, did we let these kids down:

**Recommend: (there is) no (hope left)**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: Scratch the Cat**

## Sam's Take:

Walk around the box. No one else in the box. The title says tag. No one is “it”.

I think this is mobile friendly, judging by the on-screen joystick. I join my own game via my cellular device. Now someone can be “it”. The game screams to remind me that it is horror. I throw my headphones down. “Ow”, I say.

I tagged my phone-self and prepared my ears. I was right to prepare. The sound. Then credits. This is a tag game with credits.

Bad Tag Hurt Ear.

Killing of a Sacred Deer.

I haven’t seen that movie yet, but I saw Poor Things recently.

Same director.

Poor Things is very good.

**Recommend: Poor Things**

**Replay Percentage Chance: No**

**Time Played: If I played on two devices, do I count my time twice?**
