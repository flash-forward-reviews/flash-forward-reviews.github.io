## Skeeter's Take:

It’s my birthday today, and for my birthday I wanted to torture Sam by making him play Mad Libs Randomized Birthday Card Game again. 

I also wanted to keep it Halloween themed since it’s SpOOky month.

**Recommend: After the third time, I think I can safely say “no”.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 10%**

**Time Played: 32 years**
