## Skeeter's Take:

There really isn’t much to see here. You wander around a floating square in the middle of space and press “X” on all the items in the room in the correct order. 

Oh, and you play as a bubble.

Hold on a second…

**Replay Percentage Chance: I’m out of ideas, guys**

## Sam's Take:

Don’t worry everyone, I’m doing much better today. I took work off and slept for like... 15 hours or something. I’ll sleep in tomorrow but after that I’ll probably go back to work. Think we are on the up and up.

This game is boring.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 1 Minute**
