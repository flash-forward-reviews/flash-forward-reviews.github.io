## Skeeter's Take:

That’s the set-up for “The Last NuMetal Concert”. You play a backwards hat guy that is at a NuMetal concert and if the invading hipsters touch you 5 times, you lose and fail to save NuMetal. 

However, I would like to argue that maybe not everything needs saving. Maybe we stop trying to save the pandas if they are too stupid to reproduce and save themselves? Maybe it was natural selection that killed NuMetal. I mean, do we really need to save the genre that gave us “Gangster Sexy”?:

**Recommend: “Hit the dance floor and get my sing-along on!”**

**Replay Percentage Chance: “I'm about to get it cracking and freaky-deaky”**

**Time Played: “So gangsta, I preserve my sexy”**

## Sam's Take:

I am deeply offended by the audience of only backwards-cap-wearing tank top girls.

I don’t know who it’s offensive to, I can’t explain why I feel this way. I only know that I am outraged and that this outrage is probably justified.

**Recommend: NO**

**Replay Percentage Chance: NO%**

**Time Played: 1 Minute**
