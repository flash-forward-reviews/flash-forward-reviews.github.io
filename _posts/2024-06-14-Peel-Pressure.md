## Skeeter's Take:

Peel Pressure is so damn charming. Everything from the premise, the hand drawn art, and the bizarre bananas with personalities and faces just oozes its own unique style. 

In Peel Pressure, your goal is to feed your gorilla friend (pictured below) with bananas.

Be careful though, if you feed him a rotten banana or don’t feed him at all, he goes Gorilla Mode and damages you. 

You purchase your bananas from this beautiful man - just look at that face. Mad respect to see man who’s not afraid to still rock a boombox:

He’ll sell you various forms of bananas, and as long a they aren’t rotten, the Gorilla will eat them and give you money, but the Mysterious Bananas will give you a Mysterious Banana Architect:

The gorilla tells you if you bring him enough Architect Bananas something cool will happen. He never tells you what that cool thing is, but each time you feed him one, the banana moves one space closer to the Gorilla on the board below:

I am not sure how to move the second banana track that leads to the island, but I did make it all the way to the end of the first track. 

The gorilla didn’t lie. He did, in fact, have something very cool to show me:

In an M. Night Shyamalanian level twist - that goofy gorilla was really just collecting hats for his dolls all along!

This game rules.

## Sam's Take:

Hello! It’s me Sam, here to inform you that there are indeed four entire dialogue boxes of text instructing you on exactly how to progress the bottom track.

You take the mysterious architect bananas back to the shop instead of feeding them to the gorilla. It’s actually the entire conceit of the game. Because you won’t be feeding them to the gorilla in this ending, you lose out on some guaranteed cash. 

The game has a very real loop. You get money by feeding bananas to the gorilla, which allows you to buy more bananas to feed to the gorilla. Simple enough, but every banana has a percentage chance of being rotten. If you peel a rotten banana, it will attack you and you lose half a heart, but peeled bananas are worth more money to the gorilla.

This is what causes the tension in the banana-inspection minigame. Every banana you buy can be inspected. The more brown spots, the higher chance of the banana being rotten. If you think you have a ripe one, you should peel it so you can get more money. If you think you have a rotten one, best to leave it and sell it back to the shopkeeper later.

There’s one last bit of complication to this. Not feeding the gorilla leads to taking multiple points of damage, but feeding him an unpeeled rotten banana only leads to one damage, so sometimes if you get a bad pull it can be a strat to feed him on rotten banana just to mitigate damage.

So this means, if you’re out of money, you can’t buy bananas and you get the shit kicked out of you. So the temptation to feed the gorilla a mysterious banana (which are always ripe) is a pretty important part of the game, getting the banana paradise ending is notably harder. I explain this all to say...

SKEETER IS A FAKE GAMER CONFIRMED, SKEETER CAN’T READ THE TUTORIAL AND DOESN’T KNOW HOW THE GAME WORKS. LOL FAKE GAMER FAKE GAMER FAKE GAMER ALERT: WEEEEOOOOWEEEEOOOWWEEEEOO.

For real, getting this ending was actually kind of hard:

I’m afraid Skeeter might die due to not being able to read the Mr. Yuck sticker on his laundry detergent.

**Recommend: Yes, very cool game**
