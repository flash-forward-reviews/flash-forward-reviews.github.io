## Skeeter's Take:

Dog Tinder where the player determines if the dog is a “good boy”, and if they merit a swipe right. It’s a cute idea, but the hashtags and names are all randomly assigned, and there are only a handful of photos for the profile pictures. This means you’ll usually see nonsense tags over the same picture of a dog (or whatever mythical creature is captured in the below photos) except it has a different name:

It’s a cute idea, but it would benefit greatly with some added photo variety. Don’t ever remove the propeller-hat dog, please. I can’t stop looking at his face.

## Sam's Take:

I looked at 6 dogs and 3 of them were this motherfucker:

If you give your dog a nose ring, then you should go to prison.
