## Skeeter's Take:

I’m going to keep it a buck, I forgot we still had to do our review about 10 minutes before bed and rushed to Newgrounds to find something to review. I’d like to apologize to Take Care of Mister Rat for falling victim to our shitpost scapegoat, but you were the chosen one today, and I must say, I don’t think your sacrifice was undeserved.

What’s going on here, man? I am not sure, but the shitpost demon has grown ravenous these last few days and I’m willing to feed it this succulent meal. 

O fearsome one, hear my call\
Come hither to a tasty meal\
Thirty days left ‘til we’re free from it all

I offer to you my shame and laziness\
Through this vessel of virtual pixels\
I give myself completely unto you

See me through these challenging times\
Thirty days can feel like ninety-nine\
A shitpost for you, please help speed the time 

In the name of the Alula, the Space, and the Pink Alien
