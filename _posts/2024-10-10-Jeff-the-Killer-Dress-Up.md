## Skeeter's Take:

If you don’t know who Jeff the Killer is - I envy you. 

I’m not going to go into all the details behind Jeff. Just know that he's a creepypasta creation from the early 2000s, and I guess tween goth girls got obsessed over him. 
If you need more information, Jenny Nicholson gives a great overview at the beginning of her reading of a Jeff the Killer fanfiction “Insanity”:

Also, if you have somehow not seen a Jenny Nicholson video - go spend 4 glorious hours watching [her Star Wars Hotel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0CpOYZZZW4){:target="_blank"}. Life changing work. 

Anyway, the summary of our friend Jeff the Killer: 13 year old boy has a tragic “accident”:

Which naturally turns him into a serial killer, as any horrible and disfiguring incident would. Then he goes around and murders a bunch of people he knows. The End. 

And for some reason this 13 year old, disfigured serial killer boy was attractive to tweens - because holy fuck, look at the… I guess the best word for it would be “sexualization”... of Jeff in this dress-up game.

Just remember, canonically this is a 13 year old kid who had bleach poured on him, set on fire, and killed a bunch of people. Maybe I’m just old and out of touch, but isn’t it more than a little weird giving me the option to put a “Who ate all the Pussy”? Shirt over his disgusting stomach hair trail? 

We’ve played a lot of horror games this month, but so far nothing has come close to making me feel as uncomfortable as this:

I hate this.

**Recommend: I actively recommend against it. I recommend you go watch Jenny Nicholson.**
