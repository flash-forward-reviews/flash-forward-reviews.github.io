## Sam's Take:

I had a whole intro about how we overuse the word pretentious written, but then I looked over the homepage for this game and it turns out it was made in 3 hours. I would like to complain about how the game feels like it's hiding behind its chemical acid name and industrial/psychedelic aesthetic to mask a very shallow loop. I‚Äôd like to complain that you move so slow, and the pointballs show up so infrequently that getting a score above eight feels improbable. I‚Äôd like to complain that you walk so slowly collecting balls and avoiding pillars that when you die and have to start over, the idea of having to slowly meander towards the first point-ball in the pitch black again was enough to make me close the game forever.

But they made the game in under 3 hours. It looks cool, has some sick guttural sound effects, and does successfully get harder and build tension as it goes along. I still have those complaints when playing, it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference to the end-user, but it‚Äôs not asking for donations or anything. It‚Äôs certainly functional enough to warrant putting online and possibly inspiring at least an element of someone else‚Äôs game.

I have no reason to recommend this game, but making something aesthetically cohesive is certainly praiseworthy. Good job [Temporarily Unnamed Collective](https://unnamedcollective.itch.io/){:target="_blank"}, maybe we‚Äôll play one of your non-three hour games in the future and you can get a real review.

For now, take one clap.

## Skeeter's Take:

Fluoroantimonic (wow, that‚Äôs really the name, huh?) is so close to being a banger interactive music video. 
Upon launching, I found myself reminded of [Lights by HelloEnjoy](https://helloenjoy.com/lights){:target="_blank"}. Lights is essentially an interactive music video/light show set to Ellie Goulding‚Äôs ‚ÄúLights‚Äù and it goes absolutely hard. The player can only control a little ray of light by slightly guiding it‚Äôs path along the screen and clicking/releasing mouse click to speed up/slow down. But it is absolutely perfect with the music and somehow manages to give me goosebumps every single time I play it again. 

I think with a few tweaks and changes, Fluoroantimonic could deliver a similar experience. The yellow rays raining from the sky are really damn aesthetic. Add a few variations in, some different colors, speed changes, etc. and it would be perfectly suited for a ‚ÄúLights‚Äù like experience. 

I gave a few audio samples below to give a general effect of what I‚Äôm picturing in my head:

So, yeah, I guess I‚Äôm basically saying this game would be really cool if it was something else. I don‚Äôt find slowly walking around picking up yellow orbs all that exciting, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
