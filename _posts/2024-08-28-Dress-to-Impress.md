## Skeeter's Take:

Hello. 

Hi. 

Sup. 

Hey. 

We are playing “Dress to Impress” today. I guess it was really popular with streamers a while back, so most of you are probably already familiar with this game. 

In Dress to Impress, you pilot a blank slug of a character. Your goal is to dress up your blank slug according to the theme/prompt. You have about 5 minutes to run around and dress your character up by interacting with physical items strewn across the shelves. You can visit the hair stylist for some cool locks, and the make-up mirror to gain the “face” ability. 

After the timer runs out, you head to the stage to walk the catwalk and show your fashion creation off. 

Here’s Sam’s “Maximalist/Minimalist” fit:

Here’s our duo “Detective and Suspect” outfits:

It took us a while to figure out how to change skin color, so for most of this we were running around as members of [The Fugates Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Fugates){:target="_blank"}. 

But eventually we found the tanning bed, and managed to create our Magnum Opus - the prompt was “Mean Girls” and I think we nailed it:

And the critics agree!

**Recommend: I had some fun. If your favorite part of the Sims is the character creation, go nuts. Personally, not my cup of skirts (despite my love for character creators). I do think if you get the right group of friends together and treat this like a Jackbox game, it could be a lot of fun.**

## Sam's Take:

Quick semi-real review, I like the idea of this game. It’s different enough from its [Webkinz](https://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/reminders/spectacular-supermodelz-2/){:target="_blank"} and [Animal Jam](https://animaljam.fandom.com/wiki/Best_Dressed){:target="_blank"} counterparts to merit existing. Having to walk around and see the clothes in front of you, combined with the full-spectrum color wheel adds a lot of variety to what you can create. Unfortunately the game is completely destroyed by its pay-to-win features. The outfits can technically be bought with in-game money, but are so outrageously expensive that in reality you’re going to have to shill out your parents robux to really play this thing. There’s no worse feeling than finally finding the perfect pants, only to get hit with a store link when you click on them.

I’m totally fine with people charging money for their games, but the lack of clarity of what is hidden behind the paywall creates a lot of feel-bad moments. Is it silly to complain about a children’s dress up game being pay-to-win? Maybe, but the game has Charlie XCX branding all over, so we can assume they are making some amount of bank, and the fact that  microtransaction ridden jank running on the Roblox engine (check out the animations/framerate in the video) has BRAT money is a bit upsetting to me. If this game existed on Steam for $15 in a real engine where everyone could access anything, I’d play with my Discord group on the regular. The only thing holding this game back is Roblox.

Anyway, here’s a dumbass video:
