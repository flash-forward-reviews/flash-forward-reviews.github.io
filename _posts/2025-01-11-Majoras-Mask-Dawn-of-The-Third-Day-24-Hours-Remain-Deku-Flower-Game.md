## Skeeter's Take:

This has to be my least favorite mini-game in Majora’s Mask. Time will tell, but I don’t think anything will come close to my disdain towards the clunky Deky flying mechanics. Majora forbid if you have to turn at all. 

To top it all off, we’ve got these swindlers working the joint.

Don’t think I don’t know you’re in cahoots with Mr. Clock Tower Deku!

I’ve hated this one since I was a kid, and I will continue to hate it through the future.

**Recommend: Go to jail**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Unfortunately, I need to unlock that heart piece**

**Time Played: ugh**

## Sam's Take:

What did they mean by this?

It’s not just me right? Nah you know what I’m talking about. Like, I... yeah you get it. Right?

It seems like you get it, am being weird? Haha, no... nah I’m just in my own head about it. Seems like other people get it.

I actually don’t like how much they get it.
