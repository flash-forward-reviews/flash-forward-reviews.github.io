## Sam's Take:

Honestly, there’s some sauce to this game. There are tunnels that swap gravity and make you walk on the ceiling, and I found out that throwing a grenade through them causes their gravity to reverse as well! Look at the details of Paul Bird! Sure, a quarter of the time they also get you stuck and send you out of bounds, but gotta give credit where credit is due.

Mostly the game is a clusterfuck of randomly placed enemies running around a spaceship and dying to your own grenades, but it has Steam Workshop modding support with 11 current mods, including one made by Paul Bird himself which is just the beta version of the first level, which he claims is way too hard. The game even comes with a 5 page manuel on how to mod it:

Look how happy Paul is about the first guy to make a level for his game:

The game might not be very good, but each world had a hilariously long lore backdrop done in the Star Wars intro text style, and I think we should all appreciate that. In honor of the infinite humility of Paul, I have downloaded his extra hard first level... let’s see how it goes.

I’m the Alien Insanity God.

**Recommend: Only if you are fully ready to make your own level**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 20% (Might make a level)**

**Time Played: 20 Minutes**
