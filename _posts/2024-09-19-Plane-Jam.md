## Sam's Take:

I’m on an airplane right now. The guy sitting next to me definitely noticed me using the Paint app to write “Plane Jam” in the above screenshot. I wonder what he thinks I’m doing, does he think this is my job? I hope so.

You just click on passengers and it tells you their name and age, except the dev never finished the game so instead of a name everyone is called “???”. Part of me wants to make a Doom video just to further confuse the man sitting next to me, but my hands hurt from typing in a middle seat, so I’ll leave it here

## Skeeter's Take:

I’m stinky and fart a lot.

So, I think either itch.io is having server issues right now, or Mr. Alex Carlson (the supposed developer of this game) deleted it from existence. 
Currently, here’s what I see when I try to go the game via the link (yes, I tried multiple browsers):

itch.io’s front page loads fine:

But when I search in the search bar, it takes me right back to… you guessed it:

Seems like it’s an itch.io issue. I might try again later and see if it’s back up. 

Update: WE ARE SO BACK

I have a couple thoughts about Plane Jam. 

*1.* Why do all the people look like they are on a roller coaster? Is this plane actively crashing? Is this the biggest plane party known to man? Is this what the “Jam” in Plane Jam refers to - them jamming?

*2.* Why was I not invited? I’m great at parties! I sit in the corner awkwardly,  try to avoid eye contact, and panic if someone tries to talk to me - I’m a blast!

*3.*

He was being honest! 

I just had to be sure.
