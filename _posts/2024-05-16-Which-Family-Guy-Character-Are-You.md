## Skeeter's Take:

Sam’s never going to let me pick a game again. He can’t be that mad at me because at least I didn’t choose the Family Guy game that featured softcore fart porn for it’s install instructions (this is not a joke, and no I’m not going to put you through having to see what I saw - but I DID send it to Sam as payback for the time he sent me Sonic farting on Tails). 

I really thought I was in for one of those good old fashion Buzzfeed quizzes - you know the ones that were all the rage back in the 2010s? Here’s a good example of one that we reviewed for Flash in the Pan: [Can We Guess What ‘90’s Toy You Deserve for Christmas?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kevinsmith/what-toy-is-under-your-tree){:target="_blank"}
Bold of them to assume I deserve anything. 
I assumed this would be similar - select your favorite toy, your favorite color, your star sign, etc. and at the end it would arbitrarily assign you a Family Guy character. You know, just like Pottermore did with Houses. 
Boy Howdy I couldn’t have been more off. 

The game just gives you a list of characters from Family Guy (and a Homer Simpson at one point) and flatly asks you if you are that character:

If you select No, you are taken to the next character and given a nearly identical Yes or No question (with some variation here and there). 
But if you say yes… you are met with a drumroll and a gif of a cat butt dancing winding up for the big reveal:

I don’t know what I was expecting… 

I wanted to see what happened if you said no to everything - turns out the game just determines that you’re anti-semitic:
