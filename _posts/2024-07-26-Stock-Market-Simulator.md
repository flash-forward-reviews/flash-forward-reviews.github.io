## Sam's Take:

You press the buy button when the line is low, you press the sell button when the line is high. One time the line shot below the screen, I clicked buy 10 times and the game crashed.

Sometimes the screen says “STOCKS PLUMMET” and then nothing happens. Sometimes stocks skyrocket right when the game starts, so you can’t buy anything and just have to wait until 1 share costs something lower than your starting money total.

This is at best, a passable school coding project. I’ve never seen a game more likely to be hanging on the developer’s parent’s fridge.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 13 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

Skeeter still don’t got service, so this review will be filled in later. See the previous review for more details.

Stinky Skeeter.

**Recommend: Yes!** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 100%**

**Time Played: 17 Hours**
