## Sam's Take:

You press the buy button when the line is low, you press the sell button when the line is high. One time the line shot below the screen, I clicked buy 10 times and the game crashed.

Sometimes the screen says “STOCKS PLUMMET” and then nothing happens. Sometimes stocks skyrocket right when the game starts, so you can’t buy anything and just have to wait until 1 share costs something lower than your starting money total.

This is at best, a passable school coding project. I’ve never seen a game more likely to be hanging on the developer’s parent’s fridge.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 13 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

Well, Sam, I hope you had a good time playing Stock Market Simulator. Because I could not. I could not play this game. I should have known when the download button for the  "Android" version  of this game was also the same download button for the Windows, Mac, and Linux versions. I should have been tipped off when my phone notified me that the zip file had finished its download instead of the expected .apk file. I was so ignorant.

I unzipped the file and there's just an .exe to run the game from. I don't think it's fair to claim this as an android compatible game when it's really not.

In hindsight, I really should have tested these before I left… 

Anyway, here's a mobile screenshot for you:
