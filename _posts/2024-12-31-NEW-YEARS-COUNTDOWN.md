## Sam's Take:

If a corporate boardroom made [Christmas Countdown](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-220){:target="_blank"}, it’d be this.

Sure, it actually works, BUT WHERE IS THE SOUL?!

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 2025 Minutes** 

## Skeeter's Take:

I don’t know. I felt like the background was a little boring, so I tried my hand at sprucing it up a bit:

Happy New Year!

**Recommend: I prefer Christmas Countdown**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 8 seconds**
