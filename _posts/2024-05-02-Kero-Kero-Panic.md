## Sam's Take:

Okay so first of all, I need you to know my PC did try to protect me from this game:

{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/protectpc.png" caption="" alt="" %}

But as a seasoned downloading random shit off the internet professional, I SLAMMED that run anyway button and was presented with:

{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/sadbois.png" caption="" alt="" %}

Right, so... I do not speak Japanese, but I do know someone that is trying to learn. I hit up my boi Calvin by saying “hey get on Discord” and forcing him to translate my screen with no notice. He did an admirable job of explaining that we are on a TV show, but unfortunately, some of the finer points were lost.

After the opening cutscene was over I was greeted by these smiling faces:

While I’m still fuzzy as to what I was supposed to do, from what I can tell you control six people at once through a Wipeout-style death trap and maybe try to do something until they die. While I’m not totally clear on the win condition (or if there is one) I was able to figure out you can switch who the camera follows with the “E” key, and that pressing space seems to jump roughly 70% of the time.

To be clear, when I say “control six people at once” I mean if you press forward, they will all move forward. Because of this, they will be out of your line of sight and running off the edge of the map in no time, which causes the annoncer to be either happy or sad (hard to tell, Calvin said they said something along the lines of  “oh no” when people die, so probably sad).

Towards the end of my playthrough, I figured out you could press the left and right mouse buttons to grab onto things, which might help you do something. Here’s a picture of me holding the bottom of a balloon for example:

Eventually everyone died and I asked Calvin to translate what the end screen said:

{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/deadbois.png" caption="" alt="" %}

He told me it says “your family is dead”.
