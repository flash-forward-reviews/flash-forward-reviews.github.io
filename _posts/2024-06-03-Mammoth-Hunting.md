## Skeeter's Take:

This game gave me anterograde amnesia, but I managed to leave myself some screenshots that I’m hoping will help me piece the story together:

**Recommend: No, you don’t need to play this, but I actually laughed out loud at the abrupt ending and sudden imagery of the player character getting gored by a Mammoth. Wasn’t expecting it. Bonus points for MS paint artstyle, that always goes hard. Also, there’s a distorted screaming sound effect that plays during the goring, and it’s really funny.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 2 Minions**

## Sam's Take:

Fuck it. I’m doing it. I’m recommending this. I laughed so hard playing this game, and it wasn’t even the ending that got me. The way the player character is a static image that just moves around the screen, the MSPaint spray paint tool usage outside of the cave... The fact that I can’t even put a screenshot in my review because Skeeter used every single one. This is a fucking masterpiece.

This could be the Pink Alien Transplant of this review series. One day you will know what that means.

**Recommend: Yes**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 60%, but only after it’s been long enough for you to forget about this review.**

**Time Played: 2 Minutes**
