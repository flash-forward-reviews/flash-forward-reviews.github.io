## Skeeter's Take:

As the name implies, “Marble Race Generator” is a simple little marble race generator. There are a few settings, such as time scale and time scale.

The race generator pulls from a list of pre-configured sections and links those together to form the full track. There’s an option to create your own custom sections and have them added to the pool of tracks, which is neat.

Ok
 
**Recommend: maybe**

**Replay Percentage Chance: outlook not so good**

**Time Played: yes**

## Sam's Take:

This is the second best racing game we’ve played in the last three days.

**Recommend: uh... no.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 88%. Not really but this section has been a lie the whole time anyway.**

**Time Played: Toilet Paper**
