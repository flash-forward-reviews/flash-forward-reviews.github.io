## Skeeter's Take: 

Dino Safari is kind of like Pokemon Snap, if the Pokedex only had 8 Pokemon and the game could be completed in 5 minutes.
The set-up is the volcano on the island containing the only 8 dinosaurs left on the planet is going to blow up in 5 minutes and it’s your job to take a picture and document each one before it blows. 

Walk around the island, take photos of some funny looking dinosaurs and listen to some chill pan flute music. There’s nothing offensive here - just a chill and cute vibe.

The game desperately needs a jump button as I kept getting stuck on the uneven terrain. 

In the end, I worked around the challenges that arose from a lack of vertical leap and I managed to collect them all:

The following is my favorite of the photos I took:
