## Sam's Take:

My hatred of Fart Party has some meta-context, and to delve into that, I must give you a peek into how the sausage is made. Most games have a title screen when you launch the game. Usually the game pauses on this for a while until you hit a “play” button. Skeeter and I will use that time to take a screenshot to put at the top of the website for the review. Every now and again however, a game has no title screen, forcing us to put a screenshot into Paint and write the name ourselves. This is upsetting, so we usually do not put much effort into these drawings.

I was fairly certain this game didn’t have a title screen, so I refreshed to get to an earlier game-state that I could write over in paint, and that’s when I noticed it. There was a flash of words and a picture of a cat. I refreshed again and saw it more clearly, “a fart party”. I tried to get a screenshot at the right time, but it was too quick, maybe two frames of title screen before the game started. That’s when I had the idea to record myself playing the game for a few seconds, then go through the video frame by frame on VLC to capture the moment that the title screen appears. It worked, and for my efforts I was rewarded with:

I don’t know why the cat from 50 is here, or what the hell this game is supposed to be, and I don’t care. I had to go frame by frame on a video of my own recording to get the worst title screen picture of our whole series.

At least I hated Fart Party for completely unexpected reasons
