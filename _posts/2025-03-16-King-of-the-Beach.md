## Skeeter's Take:

King of the Beach is a platformer where your goal is to bounce a beach ball on your head and get it to the goal in the level:

The ball is extremely floaty as it needs to descend slow enough for the player to have time to complete the platforming and position themselves under the ball for the next bounce. I found this floaty-ness made the ball pretty hard to control. Might get easier with practice, but thought that was worth mentioning.  

There is something going on here. Outside of the actual levels (which look like pretty simple assets - wouldn’t be surprised if they were purchased as they don’t really fit with the rest of the game’s aesthetic), the game has an interesting flair to it. The songs are pretty decent and have these great compressed vocals woven into the songs (Main menu song is a bit of a jammer). 

It feels like there is a PS1/90s vibe trying to be achieved here - for example, you can see the old paper cup design in the background of the level complete screen:

There’s clearly an attempt at style here. I’m just disappointed that a game with a game over screen that looks like this:

Also has a level design and art direction that looks like this:

## Sam's Take:

I’ve never played a platformer where you have to bounce a ball with your platforming head before. That’s neat. A new thing for me. Would you have fun doing a bounce like that? Maybe. Depends on how much you like bounce.

I’m going to ask my friend if he likes bounce.

He said, “by System of a Down, yea”.

**Recommend: Bounce**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Bounce**

**Time Played: Bounce**
