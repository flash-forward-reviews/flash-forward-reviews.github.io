## Skeeter's Take: 

I only chose today’s game, HDR Demo, since Sam has a fancy new OLED HDR monitor/TV. I technically have the capability of HDR on my monitor, but it’s HDR 400 and just makes everything looked washed out and terrible so I never use it. 

Which means there is absolutely no benefit for me using this tool/game. 
And yes, this technically qualifies as a game. I just go based on the Dev’s description most of the time:

While there is little to no benefit for myself, I figured it might be funny to see how Sam goes through the tool and if it actually helps his HDR ass. 

Unfortunately, HDR Demo has several warnings about using the tool/game for OLED monitors, and I’m pretty sure Sam’s got an OLED. I’m not even sure if he’ll get any benefit out of this, or even decide to run it.

It states burn-in as a main concern, so that really shouldn’t be much of an issue as long as the static images aren’t on screen for too long, but it’s still concerning when your HDR tool has several loud warnings about using it on OLED screens. 

It doesn’t even look like the tool calibrates anything. It’s more of a demonstration and explanation of HDR features and functions. I’m sure there’s some noticeable differences between using this on a SDR monitor vs an HDR monitor. I tried this tool/game in both modes, and it just looks washed out and awful with my HDR 400 trash. I had to take a screenshot with my phone just for the comparison:

Informative? Probably. Fun? No. 

I have to disagree, Momoiro Software, this isn’t a tool/game. It’s just a tool. I’m sorry your tool found its way onto our gaming review project. I think that’s on you as much as that is on me:

**Recommend: No?**

**Replay Percentage Chance: No?**

**Time Played: 3 minutes**

## Sam's Take:

Showing you a picture of what my HDR display is showing on an SDR display won’t work, so unfortunately I can’t show any screenshots, but I can honestly say this tool does not suck. I just got this monitor and have been trying to google how to best calibrate HDR and find out what exactly it does, and I actually learned a few things from this. Also HDR turned on automatically when I launched it, and all the tests actually worked on my display.

Also I think every monitor test tool should just have some guy’s random CP2077 screenshots in it:

Jesus, hdr screenshots look terrible when converted like that, what the hell? How does any of this work?

**Recommend: Actually kind of yea**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 25% For personal use, 0% for review**

**Time Played: 4 Minutes**
