## Skeeter's Take:

Happy October! To kick off the Halloween season I thought it would be fun to play a Halloween themed game - boy was I wrong!

I chose Halloween Graveyard Ride solely based on its name. I’m a big fan of campy Haunted House experiences and cheesy Halloween jumpscares and fun. I was expecting essentially a virtual dark ride through a Halloween themed graveyard. I was expecting to see some fun, free-use vampires and mummies jump out behind tombstones. 

Instead, what I got was a Halloween skinned Android Mobile game:

Pumpkin rolls down hill. Click to slow the pumpkin down. Don’t hit the coffins in the road or you lose. 

That’s it. That’s the game. I did not have fun. 

That’s fine, tough - Halloween Graveyard Ride also allows you to watch videos for pumpkins!

Clicking on this doesn’t do anything on PC, which leads me to believe that it probably links to a Mobile Ad if you played this on Android. 

If I can put on my conspiracy theory hat for a second - I’m willing to bet this game is another Android mobile trash game designed with the sole goal to make ad revenue off of it. 
Since the object that rolls down the hill is a pumpkin, and there is a counter for the amount of pumpkins you have, I’m thinking in the Android version you would need a pumpkin currency to be able to play the game.

This doesn’t seem to be a factor for the PC version, as you can play infinitely on zero pumpkins. I am thinking on the Android version that without any pumpkins, you don’t play the game, leading the player (read: child who got his hands on mummy’s iPad) to watch ads to get more playtime. I’m sure they start the player out with a stipend of 3 pumpkins or something trying to get the player hooked (I don’t know what there is to hook a player gameplay-wise, but I digress), and then the only way to earn more pumpkins would be to either purchase them, or watch ads to “earn” them. 

In conclusion, I am bestowing Halloween Graveyard Ride with the “Mobile Trash” award!

## Sam's Take:

Halloween Graveyard Ride isn’t too bad. It functions a little like a free-runner, except instead of pressing jump right before the obstacle, you have to slow time well before the obstacle because your pumpkin automatically bounces. It’s like a mix of Doodle Jump and Temple Run and it's super okay. The art doesn’t do much for me, and I wish the obstacles looked like something that could actually hurt a pumpkin, but I like that the music slows down when you press the slow time button. I also like that time slows a little at first but goes even slower the longer you hold the spacebar, it leads to a lot of moments where you think you won’t be able to slow time enough to land in the right spot, but then it keeps going slower and you land just before the obstacle so you can let go and sling forward at full speed.

As Skeeter mentioned though, this game seems to be prepared to have mobile ads and drip-feed dopamine bullshit mechanics built in, so sorry Halloween Graveyard Ride, unfortunately you are scum. Very sorry to tell you this. 

Please wait until people know and like your game before you put the video ad clickbait shit on there. Better yet, wait until someone is paying you to do that. If you’re going to disappoint me, get paid for it please.

In conclusion, I am bestowing Halloween Graveyard Ride with the “Mobile Trash” award!
