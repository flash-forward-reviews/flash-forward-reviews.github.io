## Skeeter's Take:

Trolley Driver is directly inspired by the “[Absurd Trolley Problems](https://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/){:target="_blank"}” game where the player is given a moral dilemma over pulling a lever and deciding how many people the trolley kills:

Trolley Driver is really only similar to the Trolley Problem in aesthetic alone. In Trolley Driver, you drive a trolley (shocker!) and try to hit as many tied up victims as possible. Each victim rewards you with blood that fills your water bottle.

Watch out! Paul Blart mall cops chase you around and try to steal that juicy blood! You’ll need that blood for upgrades - things like guns, more blood on kills, better bumpers, etc. However, there are not very many of these upgrades and you’ll run out of things to spend your blood on extremely quickly.

I think given more upgrades and enemy variety, this game could be decent. However, once you reach the maximum upgrades (that will only take you about 5 minutes to do), the game becomes rather pointless as the only option is to sell the blood for money. As far as I can tell, the money does nothing - I think it’s just there to count your score or something, I’m not really sure. 

I didn’t love Trolley Driver, but I have to say that it was a breath of fresh air not having to play Roblox today. So, I thank you, Trolley Driver. Thank you for not being Roblox.

## Sam's Take:

**Recommend:  No, if you make it for more than 10 minutes you can not die due to your blood also being your health, also there’s no sound or music.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: Enough. Don’t worry about it.**
