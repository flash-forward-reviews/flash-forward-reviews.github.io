## Skeeter's Take: 

Sam got a new “monitor” which is actually a 42”, 4k television so I figured I’d try to find the ugliest game itch.io had to offer. 

Now I’m picturing Sam sitting (according to “size-charts.com”) the appropriate six feet from his monitor while fart sounds echo through the office while this slideshow of jokes scrolls.

**Time Played: 1 minute was all I could take**
