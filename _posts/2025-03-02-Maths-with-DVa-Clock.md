## Skeeter's Take:

You answer math questions, and there is a ball-like clock dressed up like D.Va. 

Something tells me the Overwatch porn animators are going to have a heyday with this:

## Sam's Take:

Fuck, I forgot to review because I had been playing [The Roottrees Are Dead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2754380/The_Roottrees_are_Dead/){:target="_blank"} all day. By the way, The Roottrees Are Dead fucking owns. You fill in a family tree using 1998 google search and some pictures. It was a free itch game at first that used AI-art, but they scraped together some money and got real art done, some voice acting, and released an improved Steam version. I canâ€™t recommend it enough if the idea of using Google to fill in a family tree sounds appealing to you:
