## Sam's Take:

Okay, so I know last week I said Skeeter would be gone without service and it turned out he actually did have service and reviews went on as normal, so the explanation was unnecessary and false.

BUT THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT. Skeeter ACTUALLY won’t have service and he has preloaded 3 games that are Android friendly. He will review them every day as normal, but obviously without internet, he won’t be able to send them to me, so they will be backfilled in 3 days.

With that said, Ducky’s office is a mobile game where you play a big duck shooting little red ducks. Shoot enough and you can collect a strainer, which you can trade in for a meal by pressing the green circle.

The food seems to block a red duck like a shield? I don’t know. The game is not in English and even if it was there are no instructions, so I don’t think there’s any saving this one. Seems like this game might have online multiplayer? Unfortunately I’m not making an account for Ducky’s Office. Sorry to disappoint you all.
