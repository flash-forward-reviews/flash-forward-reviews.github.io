## Sam's Take:

Okay, so I know last week I said Skeeter would be gone without service and it turned out he actually did have service and reviews went on as normal, so the explanation was unnecessary and false.

BUT THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT. Skeeter ACTUALLY won’t have service and he has preloaded 3 games that are Android friendly. He will review them every day as normal, but obviously without internet, he won’t be able to send them to me, so they will be backfilled in 3 days.

With that said, Ducky’s office is a mobile game where you play a big duck shooting little red ducks. Shoot enough and you can collect a strainer, which you can trade in for a meal by pressing the green circle.

The food seems to block a red duck like a shield? I don’t know. The game is not in English and even if it was there are no instructions, so I don’t think there’s any saving this one. Seems like this game might have online multiplayer? Unfortunately I’m not making an account for Ducky’s Office. Sorry to disappoint you all.

## Skeeter's Take:

I'm very busy this summer, and will be out on vacation without service again - we have once again pre-selected some Android games from itch.io to play.
My reviews will most likely be backlogged (AKA living in my phone notes) until I return on Sunday.

You have been warned. 

Please refer to the main menu screenshot I took from my mobile phone:

You'll notice part of the screen is cut off. “Just turn the phone sideways, you knob”, the critical voices in my head are shouting. 

I tried! The end result was the same screen, except now my phone was sideways! The game technically runs, but the resolution is borked, only allowing me to see a fraction of the full screen:

In Ducky's Office's, much like the name implies, the player controls a duck who's in an office. Smaller Red ducks run at the player. One touch from the red devil birds and the player dies. The player can shoot black bullets at them to keep them at bay. 

I think the main goal is to collect 10 metal bowls that periodically appear throughout the office, but due to the sluggish and poor controls on mobile and the restricted vision, I did not accomplish this goal.  I also have no desire to continue playing to try to collect all those bowls. It seems like more effort than it's worth. 

Oh, I forgot to mention, you can press that green button that's partially cut off on my screenshot and one of the collected bowls will be consumed and a giant plate of food will appear. I don't know the function of this food, or what the purpose of this mechanic is, but I felt like it was worth mentioning:
