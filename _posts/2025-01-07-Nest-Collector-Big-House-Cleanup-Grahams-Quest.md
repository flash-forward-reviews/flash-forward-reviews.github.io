## Skeeter's Take:

I had high hopes for a game with the title “Nest Collector: Big House Clean Up, Graham’s Quest”. 

NC:BHCU,GQ did not reach the heights of those hopes. 

The set-up is fairly simple. You’re the rat collector, or nest collector, I’m not really sure. You show up to Graham’s house and he gives you the task of collecting all the rats in his home.

Graham’s a bit of an odd fella. For some reason, he’s decided to lock all the doors in his house and lock a key in each of the rooms. He hasn’t hid these keys, mind you. He’s just thrown them haphazardly on the floor.

Graham created some sort of mad labyrinth in his own house, seemingly just to fuck with the rat catcher. Nest collector. Sorry. 

I mean, just look at the guy’s living room:

Clearly something is off here. Anyway, you run around the house and collect rats and keys and open the doors with said keys that reveal more rats and keys. 

The rats, much like the keys, are mostly found sitting static on the floor:

There was a rat positioned on the couch like it was using the laptop. I liked that. I would have liked to see more rats in creative positions. 

Once you’ve collected all your rats, you head back and talk to Graham who gives a bizarre Shakespearean-esque speech about killing the rats, maybe? I don’t really know what he was saying, I’m going to keep it 100. I definitely made out something about seeking war on the “species”, which I gather is rats? Maybe it’s humans. Graham is certainly unhinged enough.

I completed the pokedex and just wanted to share my… accomplishment?

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 1%**

**Time Played: 10 minutes**

OH I FORGOT GRAHAM DOESN’T EVEN HAVE A QUEST AND HE CERTAINLY DOESN’T “GIVE” YOU ONE IF YOU ARE TO INTERPRET IT THAT WAY. IT’S NOT EVEN A SIDE-QUEST. IT’S A JOB. 

The title is a cake. Fuck. I mean a lie. 

## Sam's Take:

The collector’s life, no time for rest\
For when it comes to collection, we’re simply the best\
Whether controlled by Skeeter or Sam\
The rats will be gone from the house of Graham

Graham gives you the job, but it feels like a test\
Yet we must always collect at his behest\
We’re given the key, we enter the door\
The rats will soon learn what we have in store

Look through the house, and boy, what a mess!\
How Graham possibly lives here is anyone’s guess\
Just buy some rat traps, it’s not rocket science!\
Also why does he own but a single appliance?

We make 32 moves, a cruel game of chess\
Pick up 32 rats, zip them up in our vest\
Yet I feel like a liar, despite our success\
For we just collect rats

{% include figure.html image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/refs/heads/main/img/nest11.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

We don’t collect nests.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: All of it**
