## Sam's Take:

I would normally be more harsh on this game, but it has a very solid warning right at the start:

“Created by a 19 year old edgelord in 2013”, they know. It’s always good when someone admits they had a naive worldview when they were 19. I always encourage hating your teenage self.

Also the game has... some hope. It is obviously embarrassing, horny and overly nihilistic, but there are some creative choices. The art seems way ahead of its time for a 2013 online game. Here’s a screenshot of me and the games bartender jumping into a dumpster:

I don’t really want to put the screenshot on here, but she turns into a horny giant octopus later. I don’t want to play more, I don’t want you to play more, but I could see this dev making better games now that they got over being a 19 year old edgelord.

Pretty high effort and artistically cohesive, just immature.

## Skeeter's Take:

Never have I simultaneously cringed but been fascinated about a game more than Fuck Everything. 

On one hand, this is a very accurate sample of the writing and dialogue: 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img3/blob/main/img/fuckev4.png" caption="Castrated. The joke is that she castrated them. That’s the joke." alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

And on the other hand, this woman melts into a goo puddle by the end, and that’s the kind of insanity I live for:

See you guys, I’ve got to go eat a pint of tapioca pudding. 

**Recommend: Neh**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Nah**

**Time Played: Nuh**
