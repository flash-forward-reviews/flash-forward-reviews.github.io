## Skeeter's Take:

It’s just a single level recreation of a fake Angry Birds level. Shoot the cannon as many times as you’d like and kill the jpg pigs. 

No PNGs were harmed during the construction of this game, because no PNGs were used. 

The game slowed my browser to a crawl and continuously played music, even after closing the tab. I had to force quit my browser because of Ricard D - juego bala. 

None of this is really interesting, but what is interesting is the dev’s itch.io page.

You’ll notice, most of these games look identical but have different names in front of them. 

The other games are exactly what you would expect:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img3/blob/main/img/rica4.png?raw=true" caption="Ricardo G - canon" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

What I think is happening here is this page was for a workshop or a class and these are a collection of the projects from said workshop/class.

This pattern continues through the page. Each game theme has multiple entries all with the same person names:

Personally, I’m having fun envisioning the fiery rivalry between Ricardo D and Ricardo G. There really can only be one top Ricardo and these kids need to settle it in the console! Who will win? We are taking votes below! Click to vote for your favorite Ricardo!

Oh, I almost forgot… 

Nice job, kids!

**Recommend: Ricardo**

## Sam's Take:

I hate to say that I have a sizable issue with Ricordo D’s fake Angry Birds level. That TNT box just ain’t cutting. You can shoot a portal at the top of the screen to blow it up, but it’s the weakest explosion I’ve ever seen.

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img3/blob/main/img/rica10.png?raw=true" caption="After Explosion" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

Besides that the game is functional. Cannonballs hit the blocks, pigs fall, you win!

There are no lives or ball-limits, so you can spam away to your heart’s content. It’s just some quick thing that, as Skeeter pointed out, was probably made for some sort of camp or class. Do I recommend it? No, but you don’t care about that. You only want to know the answer to a single question...

Is it better than Ricardo G’s level?
