## Sam's Take:

{% include figure.html image="/assets/img/combat.png" caption="" alt="" %}

Since it seems you can play this game with or without combat, my review will cover “pacifist mode” while Skeeter’s will cover “combat mode”. This was decided when I messaged Skeeter and he exclaimed “I CHOOSE VIOLENCE!”. Classic Skeeter, amirite fellas?

What we got here is one of them 3D dungeon crawler affairs where you traverse a maze and talk to what I believe to be either beings born from dreams, or people currently dreaming. 34 minutes was for sure not enough time to piece together the details of the plot.

The gameplay was mostly walking down hallways and talking to creepy dudes who said weird shit. Sometimes that weird shit made sense, sometimes I was totally lost, but it managed to hit that Killer 7 part of my brain that makes me believe that if I keep playing I can figure this world out. There’s just enough connective tissue to elevate the scenes from just pure nonsense.

I was able to parse was that you are named Golem and you’re exploring a maze called Naraka, which is some sort of dream world. You have a friend in a blue skin suit who everyone liked but now everyone hates because she spoiled everyone’s dream world party or something to that effect.

Oh yea, and you are here to build a big tower. People talk about the tower. It has mixed reviews amongst the residents of Naraka.

The only real issue I have with this game is that, while there is a sort of goal of gathering a collection of items, I can’t even fathom where and how to get them. The goal of the game is so far beyond me that even after 30 minutes of play I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. Obviously this isn’t a super traditional game (look at that Gumbie lookin’ motherfucker guarding that door), but there is a stated goal of finding these objects, so it’s not like the designers are doing some sort of “there is no goal, only vibes” thing. Don’t you FUCKING DARE accuse me of being a DISGUSTING NORMIE GAMER. I just think the smallest amount of direction could go a long way as a mental lubricant to push us into exploring the rest of this world.

With that bit of criticism in mind, I have to clear something up. If I could take a detour for a moment to mention our old Newgrounds-based reviews, it is wild how much higher the bar for quality has been in this endeavor so far. Before we were criticizing basically just to clown, but these are like... real games so far. Real games made on no budget, and often in their early stages, but when I insulted Wormy Adventures 3D over 5 years ago it was just to point and laugh. When I criticize anything in Disillusion ST, it is because I absolutely believe these devs are absolutely capable of creating (and frankly already have created) some incredible work. The fact that I have any story to talk about already puts this far above almost all Newgrounds entries, but like, look at these screenshots!

Look at the fog! Look at the Saturn-era early 3D crunch! This game has actual art direction and a minimalist horror synth OST that fits the grimy tone perfectly. The gameplay is certainly a little sparse, but this is a project in early access (currently listed as version 0.16), and reading the patch notes it seems like a lot of meaty content is getting added in each patch. This was submitted for a game jam called LSDJAM (for games inspired by [LSD - Dream Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD:_Dream_Emulator){:target="_blank"} for the PS1) and it seems like they’ve been updating it consistently since then. I’m not totally sure where this will go, but the vision is there.

It seems like the devs are on a rough monthly update schedule, and I absolutely plan to see where this project has gone later in our project. Also the reviews seem to imply that there is a fully fledged card game later that I have yet to find, so I'm excited to see what that’s all about. Right now all the different scenes feel pretty disparate, and the hallways between them exist mostly just to vibe before talking to each character, but I have never come close to making anything that looks or sounds this cool. The atmosphere, the dialogue, and the mystery are all there. I really think just a little hook, the smallest dopamine drip, would push this into feeling like a more complete project.

**Recommend: Hell Yea!**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 80%, but probably months in the future for them tasty updates**

**Time Played: 34 mins**
