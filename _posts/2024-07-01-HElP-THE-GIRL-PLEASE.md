## Skeeter's Take:

“HElP THE GIRL PLEASE”? What am I supposed to help her with? She’s already got it all! What could I, a lowly man with nary a dollar to give, even help her with? I mean, just look at her:

She’s got everything she needs already! Convenient rank-like wheel feet (especially useful for Roller Rink birthday parties), Cool wire hair for ultimate AM radio connectivity, and a rigid-steel skeleton that doesn’t allow her to move her limbs, but does give her the ability to cling on to any edge she sees fit:

Not to mention, she also has the enhanced cybernetic ability to shoot photon lasers from the swinging door hatch on her belly, and she can form a cool soap bubble around herself:

So, again I pose the question - WHAT DOES SHE NEED HELP WITH? SHE’S GOT IT ALL, BABY! There’s nothing more this girl could possibly want for. “HElP THE GIRL”? She should be helping me! 

“HElP THE GIRL PLEASE” also forgot to capitalize the “L” in “HELP”, which is ironic since that’s  the very thing it is - an L.

Am I hip with the kids yet, Spoon?

**Recommend: L - Again, here is where I have to concede that I did, in fact, laugh. This game's absurdity lies in trying to piece together what the hell is going on, and a lot based on the title itself (which is really, really funny). It’s unfortunately not funny enough or interesting enough for me to want to recommend.  It falls in Limbo’s “Funny Bad, but not so bad they cross over into amazing or legendary” category for me.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: L**

**Time Played: L** 

## Sam's Take:

There you see her
