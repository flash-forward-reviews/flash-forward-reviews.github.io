## Skeeter's Take:

There’s not much to “duality”. There’s an image of an exaggerated old man/woman face with huge bulging eyes. You move two fingers closer to the eyeballs, and a Nightcore version of Slipknot’s “Duality” plays as the fingers get closer to the eyeball. There is a pitch shifting effect on the audio track where the closer you are to the giant eyeballs with your MS Paint fingers, the faster the song plays. You could theoretically find the perfect spot and play the song at normal tempo. I didn’t test this, as listening to Nightcore Slipknot is an assault on the eardrums. 

I’m not doing a very good job hiding my disdain for Nightcore, am I? 
You could tell me this game was ripped straight from Newgrounds circa 2009, and I would fully believe you. This has all the hallmarks of a Newgrounds game: JPEG images mixed with MS Paint media, an annoying copyrighted soundtrack, and an interactive loop that just barely crosses the bar of what is considered “gameplay”. The cherry on top is the Myspace glitter “mean girl” bubble letters proudly spelling “SLIPKNOT” at the top of the screen.
