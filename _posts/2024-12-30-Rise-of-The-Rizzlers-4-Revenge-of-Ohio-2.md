## Sam's Take:

THEY RESPONDED!

While it is quite sad that there are no other Rise of the Rizzlers games, I appreciate VladikXYZ’s excitement and kind response. Sometimes a weird game is just a nice kid making games for their friends. 

**Recommend: Still No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 0 Minutes** 

## Skeeter's Take:

What’s crazy is not only did VladikXYZ respond, they also answered every single one of Sam’s questions in a nice numbered list.

It wasn’t Hank Hill. Sorry for calling you Hank Hill and Drake, but I’m sure you’d do a great impression of either.

**Recommend: Are you VladikXYZ’s Friend?**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: N/A**
