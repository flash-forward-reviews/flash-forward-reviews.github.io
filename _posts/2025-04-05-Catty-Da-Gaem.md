## Sam's Take:

I’m overnight support for this week and have been getting a bunch of calls. I’m very tired. It’s a dogshit platformer with Scratch Cat. There’s a part where you have to climb onto the ceiling to progress and I couldn’t figure it out. The only comment on the game agrees:

Also every few seconds, there’s a loud noise and a couple frames of a creepy eye. It’s not scary, but it is annoying.

I hate Scratch Cat, and I hate Catty da Game.

And so can you!

## Skeeter's Take:

 I'm drunk and on the verge of passing out and I tried to play this in my phone mobile browser and couldn't figure out how to move the damn cat.

And now I get to fall asleep to visions of fucking Chester Cheeto running in place. 

At least I was able to delay the persistent Young Sheldon Dancing gif that is constantly playing in my brain.

To quote Mike Stoklasa from RLMs recent Minecraft Movie review: “When will the lord take me?”
