## Sam's Take:

Glow N’ Grow is a horrifying clash of tone that splits my brain in half. The game has a [Limbo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/){:target="_blank"}-esque shadow-bright aesthetic that gives off horror vibes. You move a cute little ball of light with your mouse, guiding a nice plant to soft royalty free piano music (jk, it’s from some guy named [Kevin MacLeod](https://incompetech.com/){:target="_blank"} and it seems like he sells his music? Sorry Kevin). When the vine hits your ball it turns red and THE LOUDEST FUCKING CRUNCH AND OFF KEY PIANO NOTE JUMP SCARE YOU AND RUIN YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

It’s not just that someone had an idea for their game but couldn’t execute the tone, but it also doesn’t feel like a purposeful juxtaposition. It honestly feels like if AI created a game and mindlessly pulled inspiration from every possible genre. The title’s Nvidia color scheme even adds some ultra-clean corporate aesthetic to this.

There’s something so wrong with Glow N’ Grow that it fully distracted me from the fact that the vine just catches up to you after 20 meters or so, rendering the game impossible after that point.

Glow N’ Grow has less humanity than a [Pink Alien](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-100){:target="_blank"} pre-surgery.
