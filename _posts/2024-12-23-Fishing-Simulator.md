## Skeeter's Take:

Upon launching:

Fishing Simulator feels like a fever dream. 

There are no instructions. I pressed play and are met with the following screen, minus the fishbux that start at zero:

What the hell am I supposed to do? I click DA WARUDO!!

… Thanks. I’m glad the pause button says “DA WARUDO!!” instead of “Pause”. Good for it. 

Naturally, I clicked the shop next. I was met with three options of items I could purchase. That included: 
A Shotgun
A Shotgun
A Shotgun

A Shotgun ran a hefty price of 200 fishbux, I hadn’t even figured out how to earn fishbux yet. 

I backed out of the shop and clicked on the “Buy a Boat” button, which just ridiculed me for being too poor to afford it. 

Finally, I clicked on the “O” square. And wouldn’t you know it? It moved!
I clicked again, and it moved again. I repeated chasing the “O” around the screen until a message popped up:

I dealt 20? 20 what?? The Skate Fish? No way that’s a real fish.

I stand corrected. 

Essentially, Fishing simulator is an aim trainer. Click the “O” and then when it moves, click it again. 

I don’t understand how the game decides when you’ve caught a fish and when it escapes, but it feels so chaotic. 
You receive fishbux for catching a fish, however.

So, I turned on my auto-clicker to speed up the process to be able to afford one of the $200 shotguns.

After a while, I had finally saved up $200 fishbux, but I made a fatal error. When headed to the shop, I accidentally moved my mouse over the “Buy a Boat” button. 

And this time, instead of making fun of me for being poor, It allowed me to  buy a boat. 

FUCK.

As far as I can tell, the boat is only here to take you to the boss, which gives the player a big “escape” button, then calls the player a “pussy” for trying to escape.

But the reason I was trying to escape was because the boss doesn’t really seem to exist. I was attempting to catch fish, but there was no indication of a boss. I don’t think the boss really exists. I even bought a shotgun and took it to the boss area only to receive some shitty fish. I have no idea what the hell I’m supposed to do there, and I probably never will. 

And I hope I never will. 

Good work for a first game! Keep trying!

**Recommend: No**

## Sam's Take:

The fucking things I do for Fishing Simulator...

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/fishsim9.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

Oh actually this game requires the 8.0 version of .NET my bad.

Once we got that out of the way, I used ChatGPT to create a Python script to autoclick the O button for me while I looked for a 9-Volt battery for my friend.

This all turned out to be pointless, because you can just give yourself infinite money by editing a text file in the game’s folders.

I tried every combination of clicking on shop, boat, and pause I could think of, but could not get the final boss to appear. I think this could very well be the most broken game we’ve ever played outside of games that just didn’t launch. Was this game made without an engine? Like they just straight coded a game? If so then like... kind of impressive TBH.

I don’t know what to do about Fishing Simulator. It is tantalizingly close to being understandable. I feel like the Russian lady at the end of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull who screams “I want to know” over and over again until her face melts or whatever the fuck happened in the movie.

**Recommend: I don’t know how to answer this question.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: See Above**

**Time Played: 30 Minutes**
