## Skeeter's Take:

Bus is a game about driving a bus. In Bus…

Oh, did you think I was going to do a normal review instead of posting a video for the 30th time so I don’t have to write about Bus? 

Sorry.

**Recommend: BUS IT DOWN (no)**

**Replay Percentage Chance: THAT’S BUS-IN, DONKEY (5%)**

**Time Played: THE BUS. THE BUS ARE IN MY EYES. AHHH. (I don’t want to talk about it)**

## Sam's Take:

What's the fucking point?
