## Sam's Take:

Scary Stories is a multiple choice Mad Lib that is very similar to Pathologic 2, in that it has meters.

You tell scary stories to fill up your friend’s fear meters, and they go down if you don’t tell stories. The strat? Just keep telling stories. Keep clicking “compose story” and going to town.

Maybe some options scare certain people more, possibly repeating stories gets less effective, but I just kept clicking the first choices over and over and the fear kept going up so...

Seems like someone was learning how to replace text dynamically, and they sure did figure it out. Well done! 

**Recommend: Nope**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 2%**

**Time Played: 5 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

Scary Stories! has some interesting ideas at its core. I like the idea of flipping the Mad Lib formula on its head and telling Mad Libs to an AI audience. 

I was all ready to tell these little bozos sitting in my story circle a frightening tale of the all-powerful butt vampire and his army of butts, but alas I was thwarted!

Pre-selected options? And not a single butt?? The audacity!
I was still interested to see what story would be generated from this and I was duped yet again! There was no story, there were only my choices with a few select words added between them to make them full sentences.

At least Shaun found it scary. Butt in all fairness, he didn’t see the butt draft. 

He hasn’t seen the _vision_.

**Recommend: butt** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: butt**

**Time Played: butt**
