## Skeeter's Take:

I wish I had more time and brain capacity to contribute to Juice Galaxy today. 
I only played through the tutorial level, but I am interested. It’s strange atmosphere and kooky characters have me intrigued. 

I had the chance to make this abomination:

That felt pretty neat. I liked how my paper thin arms held my giant hands like a wet noodle.

You are a student at a supposed classroom. Mrs. Slitherss your snake-like teacher gives you a quiz. You have to answer correctly, otherwise you die. 

The impression that there is something Mrs. Slitherss is hiding something from you is extremely strong. It feels very “Fallout 3 Intro Vault”. 

I met this guy. I like this guy. His name is Ingot. They gave him the best camera angles in the game. He tells you to fly to the roof to grab a morning star so you can beat him to death with it.

Ingot is chill. 

You collect enough juice to open the mouth shaped door on the other end of the playground. Mrs. Slitherss yells at you as you descend into a galaxy. A Juice Galaxy. 

I stopped there. Seems promising and is very unique. A world unlike any I’ve seen before and I’m all for that kind of originality. 

Hope we play more later, but I’m so tired. Sorry I didn’t have much to say today.

## Sam's Take:

I’m going to be real here, this is possibly the most under-qualified I feel reviewing a game so far. Juice Galaxy was roughly a billion time larger than I anticipated going into this, so I completed the tutorial, died doing the first quest, then drove as far as I could in a car that goes 99999999mph just to see when the world would end...

AND IT NEVER DOES. 

Juice Galaxy starts off with a cute quirky little intro sequence where the snake teacher... actually Skeeter just finished his review. Read that. What he did, that’s the intro. It’s like that.

Once you get to the Galaxy though, it was my greatest fear. Massive procedurally generated world. At least I’m assuming it’s procedurally generated? On my 30 minute one way drive I spotted several reused buildings, and there was no end in sight. As I drove, the monster level went up, which caused all the mobs to do more damage and have more health. So I’m guessing this is a sort of infinite scaling sort of deal, you can go on forever fighting harder enemies until you die.

The reason I say that I maybe shouldn’t be reviewing this is because there is a main story... but I never engaged with it. The enemies there killed me in one hit, so I assumed I was supposed to grind low level guys for juice to spend on skill points, then got distracted driving out as far as I could. Maybe the main dungeons have more meat to them, and the driving around an infinite world is just for in-between bits.

I don’t know about Juice Galaxy. I literally don’t. If it is just number scaling with a funky aesthetic, then I’m not interested. I would like to play a little of the main quest before truly passing judgment on it though. We will do this again. Skeeter can continue on with whatever the fuck he does, I’ll use my newly leveled up character to attempt some main missions. I’m skeptical, I feel like when someone creates an infinite world that’s usually the focus, but I did drink a bottle only for a big vampire bat to come take that juice away then say “I’m going to go nap now... bye”, so there might be something going on.

Did either of us explain what this game is?

There’s like... weird physics with the weapon... it floats in front of you and you use momentum to send it at the enemies. I liked to run in a circle and have it spin around me.

You fight things? They give you juice? You use that to level up your character?

Umm...

Yeah it’s like that. Okay. Sure. 

Why can’t I write reviews anymore? Work has been stressful recently. I’m going to take a shower.
