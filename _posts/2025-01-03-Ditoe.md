## Sam's Take:

Normally when looking at possible games to review, I skip this sort of visual novel type games. There’s a ton of them, and there’s usually not much to talk about. I expected to skip this one as well, but one screen changed that. It started out normal. Another self insert main character being self deprecating about their own laziness and getting on the train, but then after an accident on said train, an alien comes down and says this:

I don’t know why this was so embarrassing to me, but something about the fantasy of getting abducted by an alien from Sims 2 makes me want to die in Minecraft.

It’s revealed later that the main character of this game goes to University... so they are a full-on adult. Am I being too mean here? I should probably try not to judge someone based on free content they were brave enough to post online. If I made this though, I’d bury it 15 folders deep on a thumb drive.

I guess my point is that this dev is much braver than I am, and should therefore have more self-esteem than they are depicted with in this game. I don’t think this review will help with that... I hope they don’t see it.

I hear what Sam is saying, but I view this through a more melancholic lens, I suppose.

Just wanted to get that out of the way. 

The entire game, as far as I can tell, plays on a loop. You can either try to schmooze the alien, and then choose to go to class or be hit by the car again, which restarts you back at the alien introducing himself. If you choose to go to class, you have a weird dream about Dr. House (I’m not kidding) and wake up back in bed, starting the game over. You can choose to be abducted by the alien and after a surgery scene, you wind up back in bed at the start.

This felt extremely frustrating. Every time I tried to discover something new, I would wind up looping back around to things I had already seen. I don’t know if there is some deeper meaning behind this concept, but judging by the Sims 2 reference and this…

…I would wager it was just a neat idea the dev had. 

Here’s the thing that is hard to ignore; like Sam, I also believe that this is a self-insert character:

And while I don’t think there’s anything wrong with self-insert characters, it does make me analyze the game from a different point of view. 

The inciting incident revolves around a car crashing through a train in a crash that is hard to believe isn’t fatal. The Sims fantasy aside, I think that’s sort of the heart of this. I see someone who feels trapped in their circumstance. Someone who (supposedly) self-inserted themselves into a game where they have to relive the same hellish groundhogs day, being struck by the same car, having the same botched surgery, and worst of all, having your Alien Husbando make this face after you forcefully kiss him on the mouth:

The point I’m trying to illustrate is, this isn’t a happy fantasy. 
And while I’m not going to try to computer chair analyze someone over the internet from a game they made, I want to say to the dev - I do hope you are happy. Don’t ever hesitate to reach out to others/professionals, and I hope you have some good friends looking after you in life. I hope you find that Alien Sims 2 husband you’ve been looking for.
