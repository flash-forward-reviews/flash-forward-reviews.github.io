## Skeeter's Take:

[Sprunki](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-156){:target="_blank"} wishes it was Blob Opera. This is one of the more fun online music games I’ve played. You have control over four blobs: Bass, Baritone, Treble, and Soprano. Grabbing a blob and moving it up and down will change the note it sings. Moving it left to right changes the vowels it sings. The other blobs will always follow the highest register blob. I like the amount of control you have. Really makes it feel more like you’re conducting or playing an instrument rather than just stacking loops on top of each other. There are preset tracks you can select for the blobs to auto-sing, and that’s a neat touch. 

I must admit, the singing felt less like a Blob Opera and more like a Blob Catholic Church:
