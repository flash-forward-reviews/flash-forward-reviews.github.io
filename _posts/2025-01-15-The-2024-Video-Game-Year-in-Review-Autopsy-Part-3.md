## Skeeter's Take:

Listen, we have to level for a second. 
I’m not sure I’ll touch much more on Balatro. I think the game is great and my Steam Deck has transformed into a Balatro Machine, but I don’t really know what I have to say about it. 
The game was made by one dude and a Fiver artist. He made it based on a game he used to play with his friends. He mostly expected just his friends and family would play it until it blew up. He didn’t look at other deck building roguelikes, so they didn’t really influence the design. He quit his job to work on a passion project that he would find fun playing. 
And the work shows. The game is super fun and addicting. It’s loosely based on poker, but your goal is to win the amount of chips required to pass each level. You collect jokers which influence your multipliers and chip counts, you can upgrade what each hand pays out, you can remove and manipulate cards within your deck. There’s different starting decks with a variety of buffs and drawbacks. The fun comes from picking just the right combination to see big numbers on the screen and feel cool about it. I can’t recommend Balatro enough. 

I had a plan to talk about the Silent Hill 2 Remake today. I’ll say it, I know I wasn’t going to rank my list, but if I had to pick a Game of the Year, it would be the Silent Hill 2 Remake. Again, I never played the original, but this game has become one of my favorites of all time. 

I wasn’t expecting Sam to finish his review in one day. I figured we would leak reviews out over a few days. 
But the man is insane. I love him. 

That puts me in a tricky place today. I was going to do a proper review on SH2 Remake, but I had a stupid idea when I was playing through the game. I thought it would be funny to take screenshots throughout my playthrough and compile them into a fake vacation slideshow of my adventures. 

I was going to add this as a fun little bonus to the end of my review, but I spent an embarrassingly large amount of time editing one of the worst videos I’ve ever made, and it’s late and now I don’t have time to properly review the game. I’m not going to pull a Sam and stay up until 3 AM. I don’t have the same ambition and drive. I don’t have the same go-getter attitude. I am a hack fraud 

Instead, you get whatever the hell this is - Spoilers for Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 2 Remake BTW:

Maybe I’ll do a proper Silent Hill review tomorrow. Maybe we move on to our classic itch.io reviews and I’ll find time to talk about my love for it on some random day.  We will see what Sam and I are feeling. 

If I don’t give Silent Hill 2 Remake a proper review, I want this video to stand as my formal review. Thank you.

## Sam's Take:

Bro, I wrote too much the last couple days, played dnd until 11:30pm, then Skeeter comes in here and hits me with Drops of J, holy fuck dude.

Fuck it, I played and edited a lot of Doom this year. I’ve edited based on sprites and sounds from games we’ve played for this review channel. Ima just play level 1-2 and put that here today. Hope you enjoy this Doom update:
