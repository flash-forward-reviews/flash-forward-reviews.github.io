## Skeeter's Take:

Sam normally plays Magic: The Gathering on Thursdays, because he’s a NERD. 
He has a cube, and they draft from the cube, because he’s a NERD. 
I wanted to pick a thematic MTG game because I’m a NERD. 

And that’s how we landed on our first “Skirting the line of what is considered a game” game. 
There’s not much too Himmlisch Card Maker - it gives you a template to make your own Magic: The Gathering cards. The game gives you tools to add different mana costs, creature types, and pretty much everything you need to make a custom MTG card. The Image uploader doesn’t work (I had to add mine in Paint) and there are no options for text scaling, so I cannot say this is necessarily polished.

Does this count as a game, or more of a “tool”? That’s a hard question. Back during Flash in the Pan we played a lot of different “Dress Up” games, where you drag and drop clothes onto anime girls and make custom waifu characters. If those can be considered games, then Himmlisch card Maker would fit right in that category. Hell, not every game needs an objective, or a point. I’m of the opinion that games don’t have to adhere to a strict set of rules of what makes a game a “Game”. Not everything needs to tell a crazy story, or have deep mechanics. I think sometimes games can be an empty skeleton for your imagination to fill with organs and skin, and see what you can create - like this abomination:

That being said, this lacks some polish, and has some strange bugs and issues. The fact that I couldn’t get the image uploader to work even after downloading the desktop app is a real deal breaker for me. But I enjoyed thinking of terrible cards that Sam should sneak into his next Cube game (See above, Sam). 

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: No**

**Time Played: 5 Mins**

## Sam's Take:

I usually don’t agree with criticism that a game is just a “worse version of x” but like... there are so many other better ones available if you just google "make fake Magic cards". It’s not the worst tool I’ve ever seen, but it has actually zero value. Sorry Himmlisch.
