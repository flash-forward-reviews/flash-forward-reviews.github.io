## Sam's Take:

[Aladdin203](https://aladdin203.itch.io/){:target="_blank"}, creator of [Space](https://aladdin203.itch.io/party-space){:target="_blank"} and [Clown](https://aladdin203.itch.io/clown){:target="_blank"}, attempts to teach me how to make it. Unfortunately I still don’t know how. I am not yet sure how to make it. Maybe one day I will learn how to make it, but that won’t be today. Maybe someone will teach me, but that person won’t be Aladdin203.

Thank you Aladdin. You’re always there for me when I don’t have time to review a real game. You always have another PowerPoint labeled with the “game” tag for me when I need it most.

Wow! Can’t wait to see what food the “cooking” tutorial slideshow has in store for us in part 1!

And part 3!
