## Skeeter's Take:

We’re back with another [BM bongTextPro](https://bm-bongtextpro.itch.io/){:target="_blank"} classic game today - Spongus grows hunger!

BM bongTextPro clearly has a particular style - that style being MS Paint blood and murder. 
While I love [Mammoth Hunting](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-34){:target="_blank"} with all my gills, there’s something about Spongus grows hunger that just isn’t hitting for me. 

I’m not entirely sure why. Perhaps it’s the recognizable IP, or the fact that the joke of “Uh oh! Thing dead!” Just isn’t as funny the second time around. 

With Mammoth Hunting, I could have never seen the ending coming, but with Spongus grows hunger, as soon as I saw the goal was “Go look for food” and saw Gary sitting there, I knew it was going to end with Spongebob eating Gary:

I am having trouble getting over what I consider a pretty big logic hurdle with this one - a hurdle that has all but suspended my disbelief. 

Spongebob is hungry. I get it, everyone has to eat - even sea sponges! However, if you showed someone a picture of Spongebob and asked them to describe the character, I would be shocked if “He’s a Fry Cook” didn’t come up as a descriptor at any point. In fact, him being a fry cook is so essential to his own identity that it feels weird that it’s not even mentioned. 

Aww, you’re hungry Spongebob? If only there was some place that you could buy food from… it’s not like you’re unemployed or anything. After all, you do have that sweet fry cook gig at the Krusty Krab. You know, one of the most popular restaurants in Bikini Bottom? If only there was some place you could get food so you didn’t have to eat and kill your beloved pet snail. 

With Mammoth Hunting, I was fully onboard. I do credit some of this to the fact that the parka-wearing caveman wasn’t a recognizable character from a popular IP with a fully fleshed out backstory. He was just some hungry caveman looking to hunt a meal, only for it to end in absolute tragedy. I was rooting for the guy! Yeah! Go get that mammoth! But with Spongebob, I know too much. I know he has a job as a fry cook that can support his lifestyle of wanting to work as a fry cook. I’m assuming he could easily purchase a Krabby Patty if he even attempted to leave the house. Instead, he goes to the kitchen and then eats his favorite pet. A pet that he was so distraught over, we got a whole montage to a fuckign stupid Randy Newman-esque song about how much he misses him:

I AIN’T BUYING IT

I’m being intentionally pedantic, but it is interesting how throwing something so popular and recognizable into your game immediately switches the whole tone and feel of a joke. Mammoth Hunting had true shock and surprise. The joke was subversive and played on what we expected to happen (caveman kill mammoth). Spongus grows hunger leans heavily on the shock of seeing Spongebob eat Gary. It uses the recognizable characters to set up the expectation it wants to subvert, but doesn’t take the character’s personalities, backstories, or motivations into account. It simply uses them as sock puppets to tell another “shocking” story. You could replace those characters with any other characters and the joke really wouldn’t change that much for me.

Actually, hold on, maybe BM bongTextPro is on to something… 

**Recommend: I’M A STONE FACED KILLER LIKE MY MOTHER FUCKING HOUSE IS**

**Replay Percentage Chance: DIAMONDS HIT THE DO-SI-DO AND SMACK IT WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS**

**Time Played: HEARD THEY WANT A SOLO I CAN’T DO THAT TIL WE OUT THIS**

(meow, meow meow) 

## Sam's Take:

He never grows hunger.

He starts hunger then ends not hunger.

Title wrong! Stoopid game.

**Recommend: Sorry, it’s very late, I watched a 3 hour movie tonight**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Honestly, Skeeter’s review is more unhinged than Inland Empire**

**Time Played: Peppa Pig pic is goin’ hard tho**
