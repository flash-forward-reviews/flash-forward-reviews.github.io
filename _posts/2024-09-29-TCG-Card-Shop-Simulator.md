## Sam's Take:

This game is the story of the dumbest person on earth making the most ruiness choice of their entire life:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/tcg2.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

I wanted to really role-play a character that would make this choice, so I name the store in a way I felt was befitting of such a person:

I bought packs on my phone, stocked shelves, made change, and repeated until my character picked up a box and then the ui glitched out and I couldn’t put it  down or interact with anything else, ending my run there.

Look, I’m in a horrible mood from a stressful weekend and I hate simulator games. I do not understand people who want to work after work. I can kind of fuck with Roller Coaster Tycoon because the work is so high level that you feel more like a god than a laborer, but games like this just bring me back to working at Starbucks. I don’t want to make change ever again in my life.

Skeeter loves this game and can probably explain it better. If you don’t like work sims this won’t change your mind, but if you’re a fucking freak who just can’t get enough of stocking store shelves then ignore all of this and read Skeeter’s review.

What the hell is wrong with you people?

**Recommend: Not if you’re me**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 12.34% (maybe I’ll be more into it when I’m in a better mood)**

**Time Played: 30 minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

I know the working simulator isn’t for everyone, but I’ve been enjoying this one. I’ve never really played a working simulator like this, but I’ve seen people stream Weed Shop Simulator and such, so I’m sort of familiar with the genre on a very surface level. This game does one thing that I think is different - it lets you gamble! That’s right, in TCG Shop Simulator you run a shop that sells card for a Pokemon card game rip off!

Here’s my humble level 17 shop:

The concept here is pretty simple. If you’ve ever worked a retail job a day in your life, this game may trigger some awful memories. Don’t worry, the customers won’t complain directly to you (just to themselves out loud), you don’t have to make small talk, and you don’t have to deal with the chaotic nature of people. Turns out running a till can be pretty relaxing when every single person pays without ever uttering a word. 

Your day consists of making sure the shelves are stocked with cards, and checking customers out at the till. Thankfully, time stops before open at 8am and after close at 9pm allowing the player to have plenty of time to stock and do prep before opening to the public. Not only does this free up a ton of potential stress on the player, it lets the do one thing: 
 
Remember how I mentioned this game lets you gamble? Well the main shtick is you can open the card packs you sell and try to win big money by finding expensive cards.

This process can be very time consuming, but thankfully there is a speed slider for opening packs and the game automatically stops to notify you of any card you find over $10. 

This is where the real game starts for me. You think the high you feel when you drop a $900 card is unmatched? Try the feeling when you sell the $900 card you just dropped - it’s like looking God in the eye. 

The game gives you all sorts of ways to hook you back into this mechanic too - the market you buy your cards from unlocks higher tier packs with rarer (and more expensive) cards. You can gain access to these packs by leveling up your shop. Your shop gains experience every time you make a sale, open a card pack, or sell playtime at the tables.

In addition to cards, you can also buy fun accessories like dice, plushies, posters etc.

Naturally I ignored all these except the card sleeves, since those sell like hot cakes and the deodorant (more on that later). I’m chasing the big money in the packs, after all. That’s why I’m currently in debt. I spent all of my three thousand dollars I earned in sales on boxes of cards that I plan on opening and now I’m in debt:

Turns out, even with cranking the pack-opening-slider to max, going through that amount of boxes is going to take some time… But it’s going to be worth it once I hit Pigni - Full Art Common Foil for $2,078.76 and can finally afford rent!

Oh, did I forget to mention - you need to pay rent and electricity?

In addition to card opening, you can do a bunch of other cool things like:

Spray stinky people with deodorant to keep the vibes of the store positive, and the customers happy - these are your biggest enemy and they are very common. It is a TCG shop after all. Much realism, So wow. 

Doge.

Overall, while I find this game addicting and relaxing, I think most of my enjoyment stems from opening card packs. 

Gambling. 

What I’m trying to say is I like gambling. 

I’m so glad I never got into Poker. I’d probably be addicted to Hard Cigars and wear a white tank top right now if I did. 

Anyway, the game is in early access and there seems to be a lot on the roadmap - I’m personally pumped for “Can sell old shelf”.

(I’m not even memeing, it’d be so nice to be able to sell old shelf)

Before I leave, I just want to share one of my favorite things I like to do when I’m not tearing open packs - leaving my sign flipped to Closed and watching the disappointed people shake their heads in disapproval through the hazy glass.
