## Sam's Take:

We ride the horse. We scroll through the infinite repeating canyon graph paper. The mountains mean nothing, they are merely there for show. We can wander the screen freely. The only thing we must avoid are the gunmen, for they are angry and linear.

The rock is red, this much is true. The gunmen are flat, yet we are given the gift of a third dimension. Wait, what is that I hear?

Nothing.

There is no music. No sound.

There are no points, no objectives.

No Gods. No masters.

The desert may loop forever, but we will not. We are so close to done. So... so close.
