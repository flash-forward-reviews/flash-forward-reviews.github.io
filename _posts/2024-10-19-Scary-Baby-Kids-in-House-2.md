## Skeeter's Take:

Well, I had a genuinely unpleasant experience with Scary Baby Kids in House 2. 

It’s never a good sign when the only options in the settings are speed and turn speed:

Clearly, Scary Baby Kids in the House 2 was made for that direct target audience - baby kids who are in the house playing on an iPad. The set-up is you are a babysitter watching some stupid looking clown child:

Your overall objective (at least for level one) is to feed the little Bozo and put him to bed. 

I mistakenly clicked on the “Sit on couch and watch TV” option when the objective clearly said “Get bottle from fridge”. The game decided to punish my mistake by locking me to the couch, and forcing me to watch a horrifying and uncanny video of someone approaching the precipice of changing one of these “Scary Baby Kids” before resetting and looping. I sat there like Alex in that one scene from a Clockwork Orange until I force closed the application:

Not feeling very motivated, I pushed forward and restarted the game. 

This time I managed to get past the bottle puzzle and not sit on the couch. Much like the television predicted, I had to change the awful child:

Though, after placing the small clown on the changing table, he disappeared on me. 

He must be quite the fan of Trainspotting:

I put the baby to bed, and the quest log asked me to head to the computer to check out “Chapter 1 game”.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

I don’t know why this was made. I don’t understand it, and I stopped after the computer screen played that stupid video again. 
Also, the mouse doesn’t lock to the application so I spent most of this game clicking in and out and readjusting my view. 

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: No**

**Time Played: 7 mins**

## Sam's Take:

While I absolutely understand Skeeter’s disdain for this game... I kinda think there’s hope with this one. It’s not good, I’m not going to recommend it, but they’re almost on to something. The doing repetitive baby tasks creates a routine, and having the routine be interrupted by the baby going missing could be functional horror. Also there’s some weird meta-lore implied by every screen showing someone else playing a very similar game (I assume some sort of alpha build of the game).

That all being said, while the pacing is fine, the game is too silly to be scary, but also just is never funny. Not in a Newgrounds humor sort of way, more in that it never tries to be funny, until maybe the very end when the evil toys start lighting the house on fire and spraypainting with perfect Microsoft Word fonts.

SBKiH2 is stuck in the middle of horror and comedy without effectively blending the two, but it does have some effective pacing. I don’t recommend it, but we’ve also played too many non-functional games for this series for me to complain too much. I don’t recommend it, but I think there’s hope for this dev one day.

**Recommend: No** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 1%**

**Time Played: 13 Minutes**
