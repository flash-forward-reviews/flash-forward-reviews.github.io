## Sam's Take:

You walk. Shrek get u, game start over. No way to win, nothing else to do. I hope Skeeter’s review doesn’t make me uncomfortable.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 1 minute**

## Skeeter's Take:

Shrek chases you. He chases you through some dark woods. If he touches you, the game restarts.

I’ve got to disagree, my friend Lordweegie. I think you nailed both Shrek and the penis trees! The resemblance is uncanny!

Nice work! I have made zero 3D models myself (you already have me beat), but I assume they are hard work!
