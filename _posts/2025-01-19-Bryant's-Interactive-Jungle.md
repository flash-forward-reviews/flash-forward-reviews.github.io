## Skeeter's Take:

To me, it seems like Bryant’s Interactive Jungle was created by an animator that wanted to make animations rather than someone who wanted to make a game. 

The game is broken into short animated vignettes. Click on the icon and a short animated loop plays and something vaguely comedic happens to Bryant.

There’s a dance sequence that has a soundtrack of the Donkey Kong rap, but with the lyrics changed to something about Bryant (it’s really hard to tell what he’s saying).

Bryant has a Spider-Man shirt on. That’s pretty cool.

By far the most interesting thing about this game is the bug I found. If Bryant is talking (he has a line about being a monkey he’ll say randomly, but you can also click on his face to punch him and he’ll yell at you) and you click on one of the animation sequences during his talking animation then the next clip will play back super quickly - almost like a fast forward mode. 

Anyway, not much to write home about. 

**Recommend: Naw**

**Recommend: Skeeter CALLED IT!**

**Replay Percentage Chance: The wiki says they are on season 16 of the show, but I can not find anything beyond season 7**

**Time Played: I watched a few episodes... I don’t understand the Undertale community, but you animated 16 seasons of a webtoon, so I applaud you from afar.**
