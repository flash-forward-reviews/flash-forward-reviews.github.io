## Skeeter's Take:

Back in our Flash in the Pan days, Sam and I had a whole week of reviews where we only played Mad Libs.
It was a miserable week and I sure hope I didn’t just jumpstart us into another Mad Libs fiasco with this choice today… Guess we’ll find out tomorrow. 

“Mad Libs Randomized Birthday Card Game” has a few oddities that raise it above other flash/browser Mad Libs games we’ve played in the past. 

First, this isn’t a traditional Mad Libs game where the words the player fills in might be used to tell a short story. Instead, random words are used to make the world’s worst birthday card. 
The main title even touts this as an answer to you not having enough time to fill out a birthday card. Maybe it’s just me, but if my friend told me they didn’t have time to grab me a birthday card, but did manage to throw 3 words into a Birthday Card Mad Libs maker, and screen shot that, I would tell them I would have preferred no card. (Just kidding, that would honestly be really, really funny). 

The game prompts the player to input their 3 words via browser text box:

I found out that if you click “Cancel” it will send you to the next prompt box without accepting an answer, which results in the following birthday card:

In case there was any doubt that the intended use of Mad Libs Randomized Birthday Card Game was anything other than “Oops I forgot to get you a card, here’s a screenshot of this Mad Lib game I found online”, the dev has put a nice message to remind the lucky receiver that “Today I forgot it is your Birthday!”. 

Sam, I sure hope you’re looking forward to your birthday card in September. I hope that you null the null.

**Recommend: Worst Mad Libs we’ve played in practice, but also the funniest and most practical.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 100% on Sam’s birthday**

**Time Played: 6 minutes**

## Sam's Take:

Skeeter chose this game not knowing it was my wife’s birthday, so I made her this:

She responded with “What? Ski the balloon? SKI THE BALLOON? SKIDABALLOOONNN?!”

She was not pleased.

**Recommend: No** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 100% unfortunately**

**Time Played: 1 min**

*SKEETER NOTE: I’m so sorry [NAME REDACTED]. Much like my gamer status, I am a fake friend.*

*Today I forgot it is your Birthday! Please forgive me, I made you this!*
