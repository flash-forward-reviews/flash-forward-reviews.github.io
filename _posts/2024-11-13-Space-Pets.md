## Skeeter's Take:

I was doing my daily grime-crawl search through the new game section on itch.io when I noticed something peculiar:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/spacepets3.png" caption="Damn, I think I might have overlooked “My Family Made This Game”. Looks like a banger." alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

That’s right folks - it’s Class Submission time again! This time - we look at three identical projects!

It seems the goal of this project was to modify 3 things in it.

Let’s see how they did!

**Space Pests:**

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/spacepets4.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

Did not load in the browser - trying to download currently to see if I can get it running. 

Download worked!

There are two mobs here. I have no frame of reference for what the original mob was, but since there are two I’ll say “Pass!”.

Those are technically props! No idea what the hell these things are, but they were definitely added! So, “Props” to that!

And that is a smoke effect! Good job! Your project isn’t all smoke and mirrors! 

I give Space Pests a “Pass” - good luck on the project!

**3D FPS (by Shy!):**

Game loaded in browser - bonus points!

As far as I could tell, there was no added music. The song remains the same (Led Zeppelin) as the song in Space Pests. I give this point an “EPIC FAIL”.

I can’t tell if these are new textures or just different shading. I suppose it does change the game “environment” a bit - I’ll give it a pass.

I found more of whatever these green octopus things are  - thinking Space Pests didn’t add these as props now. Mistakes are a part of the discovery process! I should retract points, but I’ve already graded. 

The last note about a new and engaging level was also a lie.

I don’t think this person did anything other than change the textures as far as I can tell. 

I give this project an “EPIC FAIL”. Good luck on your submission!

**3D FPS (by BIGBUCKEYY):**

There are no new levels. 

There is no new boss. 

There are no new features in the game menu. 

I am just now realizing my own idiocy. As I went through these three submissions, I noticed there were very little modifications made to them, if any. My Space Pests enthusiasm waned as I realized that was just the base game. 

That’s when I realized I somehow overlooked a few very important words in two of the descriptions.

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/spacepets11.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/spacepets12.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

Ahh, these are intended modifications. These haven’t been implemented yet.

That makes me question why these were submitted? Was this game just a template for these people to follow? Did they have to build the base game from the ground up and them later in the project will have to modify it? 

So many questions. Only one answer stands out clearly to me - I shouldn’t ever be a teacher  and it might help if I saw a rubric. 

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 8 minutes total** 

## Sam's Take:

Skeeter two days ago:

Skeeter today:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/spacepets14.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

**Recommend: Someone learned to use Unity engine, great for them.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%, 0%, and 0%**

**Time Played: What the hell Skeeter**

SKEETER NOTE: This is my solitary reprieve now. The only games I’ve played in the past few days have been for this blog. Help.
