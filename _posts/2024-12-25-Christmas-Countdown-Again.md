## Sam's Take:

They never quite got the time right:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/chriscountagain1.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

But damn, that’s a pretty slick background!

**Recommend CHRISTMAS**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 5%**

**Time Played: Almost none** 

## Skeeter's Take:

I felt like the background was a little too busy, so I went through the liberty of simplifying it:

Merry Christmas!!!!f

**Recommend: FUCK YES IT’S ONLY -23 HOURS TO CHRISTMAS**

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/chriscountagain3.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

**Replay Percentage Chance: 100%**

**Time Played: 19 days**
