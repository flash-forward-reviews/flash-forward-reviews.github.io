**Recommend: There are no indicators of successful hits vs misses. There is a one minute timer on the game, which is weird for a game that describes itself as “endless”. Perhaps they meant the song that endlessly looped when Go Ham! held me hostage and gunpoint and wouldn’t let me leave the main menu (that hamster is intimidating, ok?). Task manager had to get involved, otherwise I am fairly certain you would have found me nested in my room singing “nights on fire” quietly to myself as I lay on my soiled mattress. The clumps of my hair will do a decent job of soaking up the more rancid of the liquids.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: No**

**Time Played: 1 minute played - but add an extra minute for the hostage situation.**

**Recommend: I helped someone jump their car which turned into a 2am AAA calling fiasco.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: I’m so tired**

**Time Played: NIGHT ON FIRE**
