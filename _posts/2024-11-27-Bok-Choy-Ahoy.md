## Sam's Take:

I was going to write an angry post about how this platformer is impossible, BUT I’ve learned that the reason I was dying on the pipes was because of the steam coming out of these pipes:

Once I figured that out, nothing stood in my way.

It’s one level, it’s hard to tell why you die, the controls are slippery, no reason to play this one. Cute art, good effort, not meant for public consumption.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 2 Minutes**
