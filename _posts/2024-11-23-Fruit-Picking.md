## Skeeter's Take:

Look, I know we’ve played a ton of these stupid mini-games that were clearly made for a mobile touch-screen device, but this one hits a little differently. There’s a purity here that doesn’t seem to be tainted by Ad-driven gameplay. 

The first screen I was met with was the following:

I always like a game that can boost my confidence. WIN! I hadn’t done anything besides press play on the game, but it was already giving me the highest praise possible.

This was Fruit picking’s first challenge. How could I play a game I had already won? I waited patiently for the game to start. 

WIN sat there staring at me like we were having a devil’s contest for my soul. WIN!

Yes. I WIN. I don’t feel accomplished about WIN. But I guess I did it. 

That’s when I noticed something in the description:

Ohh, duh. Silly me. That’s my fault, I’m not familiar enough with the experimental “Start the player on the WIN screen” tactics being deployed here. 

The game started up. The same 2-bar musical loop from the WIN screen restarts, this time lacking the drums.

Wow! Well worth the wait!

Apples fall from four static locations above a white glove, or hand, or Glover. The player can slowly and incrementally move the hand left or right by clicking on the corresponding green button at the top of the screen. This is mostly a useless feature as I don’t believe there is a way to lose. The best tactic I found was to position the hand between two drop points and sit there collecting two apples at once. 

When you reach 100 apples, you get reunited with an old familiar friend:

The drums come triumphantly kicking back into the tortuously repetitive music loop. WIN. 
I still feel no sense of accomplishment. Yet, there it is. 

WIN. 

It’s nice I was able to play this on my desktop, but I do wish I could play it on my computer. Wish I didn’t have to wait to play - I do hope there will be constant updates. 
I mean, really, it just feels like something is missing. I just feel like the game needs to be updated until it was created by Thai people. I think that’s the missing link.

**Recommend: No. Only the second [best Fruit-Collecting type game I’ve played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgsq6pLIcgY){:target="_blank"}**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Apples**

**Time Played: 4 minutes** 

## Sam's Take:
