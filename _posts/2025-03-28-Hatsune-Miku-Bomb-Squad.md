## Sam's Take:

Uh oh! I’m not sober, but I’m here to play Hatsune Miku Bomb Squad! It’s a puzzle, it might be a real game. Kinda hard to tell. CHECK THE SWAAAAAAAAAAAG:

Yes, this was the right answer. Earlier levels gave context, I promise it made sense. Sometimes the hits are words:

I didn’t get further than this because I might vomit soon, but I did my review. This absolutely counts. Thanks for reading this everyone. I know the reviews are deep but I hope they were entertaining. If any of them made you think about games differently in any way, then like it was worth it right? A clock that reviews every day is good twice a year. Something like that. 

I hope I don’t vomit.

**Recommend: Nah**
