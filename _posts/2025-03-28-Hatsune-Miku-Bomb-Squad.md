## Sam's Take:

Uh oh! I’m not sober, but I’m here to play Hatsune Miku Bomb Squad! It’s a puzzle, it might be a real game. Kinda hard to tell. CHECK THE SWAAAAAAAAAAAG:

Yes, this was the right answer. Earlier levels gave context, I promise it made sense. Sometimes the hits are words:

I didn’t get further than this because I might vomit soon, but I did my review. This absolutely counts. Thanks for reading this everyone. I know the reviews are deep but I hope they were entertaining. If any of them made you think about games differently in any way, then like it was worth it right? A clock that reviews every day is good twice a year. Something like that. 

I hope I don’t vomit.

**Recommend: Nah**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Isn’t everything 0% this close to the end?**

## Skeeter's Take:

UH OH - this is a certified Bababooey Bababooey Kyle Kyle moment!

I can only recognize the chiptune backing track for this game due to Kyle singing that song so much. 

I don’t really expect you guys to know who Kyle is, but he’s obsessed with Miku. He was pretty upset when that Japanese man married a Miku hologram. Everything I know about Miku has been forced upon me by Kyle, so it’s impossible for me not associate the two now. 

Since Kyle is the Miku expert, I didn’t feel that it was fair if I gave my opinion/recommendation on this game (well made, but kind of boring!), so I sent it to the resident weeb himself. I’ll update if Kyle ever gets back to me.
