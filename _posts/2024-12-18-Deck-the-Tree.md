## Skeeter's Take:

Wow, I really didn’t think this one through as far as having to write a review goes. There’s really not much to say about Deck The Tree. You decorate a tree. There’s not a lot of flexibility on how you decorate the tree. I couldn’t put the star in the middle, it could only go on top, and the ornaments snap into the general area you drop them in.
