## Skeeter's Take:

This game is really cute. It’s a hybrid chat room/Fishing game where you and your friends (or strangers online) can customize your own little Animal Crossing animals and play a fishing mini-game in the same lobby.

The game seems fully grounded in this chat room idea, and the fishing is almost like an added bonus. Like a way to pass time while you relax in a pleasant outdoors backdrop with your friends.
You can unlock new articles of clothing to show off. Each fish has an associated article of clothing, meaning if you want to unlock, for example a blue baseball hat, you’ll need to catch a perch. I like this system. Seems fun and gives more reason to search for specific fish over “Baseball cap costs 20 fish”.

There’s also a fish compendium that tracks your sizes and what you’ve caught. 

What I’m trying to say is that the fish system is fully fleshed out, but the focus seems to be on doing it with others in a lobby. 

Full disclosure that I played offline because I’m afraid of other people, so it felt like I was missing an element, but could still see that it was there. 

For example, when you type your character gets a little speech bubble above their head and has a non-coherent sound pattern that mimics speech similar to how the Animal Crossing animals talk. I’m picturing a full lobby where everyone is fishing and chatting in their little animal voices and it seems damn charming and pleasant. 

I could even see people hanging out and playing in their discord late at night to kill time.
Hell, I might just play more solo just for the fishing mini-game. 

I like this. It’s a different pace and speed than other games I normally play and seems to have some real charm and thought put into it. 

It was made in just over a week too, which I find very impressive. 

Check it out if you’re looking for a nice relaxing way to unwind at the end of the day. 

**Recommend: Yes**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 50%? Might be fun to try together. Sam’s out on lappy for a few days and didn’t want to try to have to schedule something.**

**Time Played: 15 Minutes** 

## Sam's Take:

Got bad news for you Skeeter:

But I got good news for you Skeeter!

I made a dog and failed at fishing (minigame is impossible with a trackpad), but it sure did look cute.

Like Skeeter said, this game is so simple, that it seems to be more about facilitating communication with friends, rather than the core fishing loop. The single player doesn’t do anything for me (I’m staunchly anti-fishing-minigame), but I’d be interested to play with a small group and see if it does enhance the social experience more than just hanging out in Discord normally. I’ll buy [the Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/){:target="_blank"} of the game for a few friends and give it a shot later.

**Recommend: Not this version, but the Steam version is only $5 if that’s your thing.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 50%**

**Time Played: 5 Minutes**
