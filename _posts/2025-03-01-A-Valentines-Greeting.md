## Skeeter's Take:

Yesterday, after our last minute panic to get our review out around midnight, Sam noticed that [Trivia Night at Applebee’s](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/969888){:target="_blank"} was submitted to a Newgrounds Game Jam. 

And not just any Game Jam:

And it was hosted by none other than Mr. Newgrounds creator himself: Tom Fulp!

My head cannon is he found a shitty review blog website and somehow felt inspired. I looked through his other jams, and this appears to be the first time he’s used this title for a game jam (as far as I could tell, it was puddle deep research). Plausible? No. But it’s my fantasy and I won’t compromise. 

Anyway, we will most likely be looking at some submissions to the Flash Forward 2025 Game Jam as the coincidence is too funny to be ignored. 
Which brings us to today's game/animation!

A Valentine’s Greeting starts off with an image of a heart with eyes staring blankly at the player. The heart exclaims “Happy Valentine’s Day!” in its best Microsoft Sam voice.

The heart shrinks into the background as the following text appears on the screen:

The uncanny nature of the soul-staring heart combined with the rough animations and stock sound effects really brings this package together. It’s hard to describe why something is funny, but the unintentional timing really helps drive the accidental joke home.

Is A Valentine’s Day Greeting “good”? How could I even qualify the “good” of something like this? This is clearly an animation somebody used to learn:

How am I supposed to judge when I did nearly the exact same thing to learn some video editing  during our last project 9 years ago?

If this isn’t the perfect example of why my creative opinions should never be trusted, I don’t know what is. 

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: This is my new Valentine’s Greeting for the foreseeable Valentine’s Days**

**Time Played: 1 minute**

## Sam's Take:

DUDE! I cannot believe Skeeter brought Thumpy back!! I love The Thumpy video. You know what else I love? A Valentine's Greeting. It’s short, bad, stupid, and harmless. There is nothing I could say that would express the joy it brings me that would be more concise than the animation itself. It’s like... 10 seconds long. The amount of pure empty audio-space between the heart saying “happy valentines days” and the words finally appearing on the screen is immaculate.

We are proud sponsors of the Flash Forward game jam, and would like to thank Tom Fulp for naming it after us! If Valentine’s Greeting is anything to go by, then we’re in for one hell of a ride!

**Recommend: YES**

**Replay Percentage Chance: NO**

**Time Played: ONE**
