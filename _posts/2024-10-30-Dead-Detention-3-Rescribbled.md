## Skeeter's Take:

Sam informed me that we are half-way through this project as of half-way through this review. That’s exciting. 

I will be continuing with the same “Live React” format as the previous 2 episodes. I feel like I need to see this gimmick through to the end. I thank you for bearing with me on this experience. Final episode should be tomorrow. 

00:30 - We are so BACK. We are still on EASY. We are so UP. 

03:00 - The big cliffhanger event from yesterday that concluded with Naomi Protagonist staring out on the horizon from the roof of the school. 

Turns out she was just looking at a zombie climbing up the side of the school. She failed to mention this until the zombie was already on the roof, so great work there Naomi. 
04:53 - ABC pulled out the broken baseball bat from yesterday. It’s splintered and has sharp edges that would be perfect for a makeshift shiv to stab the zombie with. 
Instead, ABC determines the broken bat unusable since it can’t be used as a traditional bat. 

This kid is fucked. He is not surviving more than this day. 

07:30 - Failed that mini-game several times. At least I got this face as a reward:

09:00 - Once again, I was so wrong about Sora. She’s the only one with any real intelligence and adaptability here. She figured out that the bat can still be used as a weapon - go figure!

11:00 -

Oh, i don’t know ABC? Maybe it’s because she’s not a complete idiot!

11:30 - LMAO 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/3dedet5.png" caption="#TeamSora" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

12:19 - Knock Knock! Student President Ryan is knocking at the door to the roof! He’s with his friend “Red” who hurt her leg. I’m sure it’s fine if we let him in. 

13:39 - TRUST NO ONE - TURN THEM AWAY

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/3dedet6.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

14:32 - Naomi didn’t approve but Sora did. Sora is my compass through this shit, so I think we made the right choice. 

16:14 - we are now leaving the only person who knows what they are doing alone on the roof with ABC’s Nintendo DS while the two colorful haired idiots venture down to the cafeteria to try to scavenge food and water.

This seems like a great plan. We also find out ABC’s Snorlax is named Lizzo. Do with that information what you will. 

18:00 - We are back with ABC’s scientist mother. She and her colleague are still grappling with the morals of their research being used to start a zombie apocalypse. She worries about her son (ABC) and wants to send someone out after him. Some commander calls and claims the “Master” needs an update. Seems like they are using this incident to collect “Data”. They could have just started a major web browser instead of starting a zombie apocalypse if they really needed data, but I’m no science person. What do I know? 

21:21 - ABCs mother is going to get help from her colleague to go save ABC from the school. 

22:06 - When you stare at the 4th wall, the 4th wall gazes back. 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/3dedet8.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

23:00 - Naomi is trauma-dumping her worries about post-graduation and Sora having trouble making friends. I want to tell her that none of that probably matters anymore, but might not be the right time. 
I think our bright colored hair kids are bonding. Maybe the start of a terrible relationship? 

24-56 - the Wario-Ware games are getting more convoluted. I’ve failed nearly every one the first time. 

25:42 - NO NAOMI, NO! THIS ISN’T THE HAPPY ENDING YOU THINK IT WILL BE: 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/3dedet9.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

26:44 - Zombie teacher. Zombie teacher - where is your bow? Zombie teacher, zombie teacher “I don’t know!”

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/3dedet10.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

Naomi ends up killing her because ABC is useless and can’t do anything. He admonishes himself and calls himself “useless”. Maybe this time it will spark real change in his character? Find out next week on Dragon Ball Z!

29:13 - It’s not over. I don’t know why I hit you with the Dragon Ball line. It just felt right I suppose. 

30:03 -  Just when I was about to buy a Team Sora jersey, Sora’s takes an idiot page from ABCs book and opens the rooftop for the class president from earlier. Turns out he’s got a zombie with him.

31:53 - Wow this baseball bat stub is getting a bunch of screentime. Sora kills Class President’s friend “Red” as she has fully become a zombie. He’s not too happy about this and struggling with the loss of a friend he probably also had a crush on. 

So naturally, I choose the option for ABC to shout at him for being an idiot.

34:04 - CLASS PRES WAS A ZOMBIE TOO. THEY CAN SHARE DEAD ZOMBIE LOVE IN HELL FOR ALL I CARE. SORA GRAB THE BAT STUB!!

41:25 - The final boss mini-game sucks. ABC is supposed to fist fight a zombie, but the controls said “Left Click = Left Punch, Middle Click = Block, and Right Click = Right Punch”. Naturally, I thought the controls corresponded with my left mouse button, middle mouse button, and right mouse button. After losing 4 times, I’m now realizing they meant I have to left click the area of the screen (left, middle, or right)... Very cool, very swag. I also noticed the zombie is sparring and punching back. Always good to see a nice clean zombie fight. 

46:00 - ABC punches the zombie and expresses his need for a weapon. We are now back with the doctors. They swore an oath to something called “Clear Moon” and “Clear Moon” used yellow text instead of the standard white, so it must be important. ABCs mom is breaking the oath to try to save her son. The commander is coming and she must be there when he arrives. He’s set to show up at Midnight and that seems to be our ticking-clock element to add some tension. 

48:26 - Helicopter Popsicle stick

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/3dedet13.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

48:54 - Finished! We have one more episode to go. Will ABCs Mom make it back in time to meet with the commander, will Sora and Naomi survive, will our player character grow out of being useless and a dumbass? Find out next time, on Dragon Ball Z!

**Recommend: I’m charmed. It’s hard to recommend, but damn I’m having a blast roasting these idiot children trying to survive an apocalypse.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Episode 4.**

**Time Played: 48:54 (Game play and Review total)** 

## Sam's Take:

HOLY FUCK I DON’T CARE ANYMORE! IT’S THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER!

But there is one weird thing:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/3dedet14.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

There are random things you can click on and some choices to make that change this screen. It wasn’t until now that I realized it was saving this information between runs... but how? I’m not signed into my Newgrounds account. Is it via cookies? Some IP address magic? How the fuck do you know that I clicked the newspaper in episode one? Fuckin wild.

Anyway, why is your Snorlax nicknamed Lizzo?

**Recommend: Almost done**

**Replay Percentage Chance: I wish this was Alula Falling%**

**Time Played: Less than Skeeter by a lot**
