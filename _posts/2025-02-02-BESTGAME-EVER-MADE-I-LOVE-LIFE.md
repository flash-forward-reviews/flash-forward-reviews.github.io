## Skeeter's Take: 

“BESTGAME EVER MADE I LOVE LIFE” - quite the title for a game about smashing crawling on your face with a hammer:

Hit your eye with the hammer? You lose an eye and the game! Too many ants? Well…

Honestly, the itch.io page for this game is more interesting than the game itself. It has a whole atmosphere to it:

Wish the game adopted any of this texture and unease. 

I was sent down a bit of a rabbit hole for this review. There is a song that plays on the game over screen that I absolutely knew and had heard before. I couldn’t for the life of me place it. I went on a search to see if I could find it. I started with Pokemon games as it sounded like something you would hear in a sacred tower or spooky location. I quickly realized I was off base on that guess. Then, it dawned on me that Sam and I had been playing Majora’s Mask a few weeks back and it definitely sounds a bit like a song from that game. I thought I had found it with “Majora’s Theme”, but it still wasn’t lining up - they were similar, but not the same song. I eventually gave in and used google on my phone to look the song up. 

This is just a long winded way of saying that Depression Nap from Cruelty Squad and Majora’s Theme from Majora’s Mask sound sort of similar for like, two notes.

This video was a waste of time. It really is just those two notes that sound kind of similar. Why did I make this? Who knows. It’s not like the comparison was necessary. I have no idea what I’m doing anymore.

**Recommend: Bug's Life**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Antz**

**Time Played: Ant Man**

## Sam's Take:

I just bought a 42 inch monitor, and this is the second game I have ever played on it. Very upset that there was no hdr support for the clicking of the ants.

Also please convince my wife this was a good investment and not a waste of money, I really need her to still like me.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: No**

**Time Played: Yes**
