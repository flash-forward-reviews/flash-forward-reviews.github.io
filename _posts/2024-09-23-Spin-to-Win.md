## Skeeter's Take:

Hurry, hurry! Step right up! Come and spin the magical wheel of pastries!

We even have a long list of unlocks you can work towards - one unlock only costs 50 dust!:

“But how do I get Dust, strange carnival man?”

Do not worry, my friend. If you roll a pastry you’ve already won, you get ONE DUST! That’s right! ONE DUST! You’ll only need to do this 50 TIMES to unlock one new item!

This isn’t spin-to-win. It’s spin-to-grind! It’s spin-to-boredom! It’s spin-to-suck!

Boo

Boooooooo

UPDATE: It appears the food can also be unlocked by landing on it on the wheel, and the dust is there to fill in the ones you don’t land on. Unfortunately, I’m still not having fun.
