## Skeeter's Take:

Have you ever wanted to be a stripper? How about a wacky inflatable tube man advertising LOW LOW prices at the local car lot? Strip Tubes combines 2 of America’s most sought after jobs into one package! 

Jostle your limp blue body around a stripping pole in front of dozens of screaming fans! Wiggle your way to their hearts and their paycheck! Don’t let that Red Inflatable tramp outshine you! Strip Tubes!!!

Strip Tubes is funnier in concept than it is in execution. The concept of wacky inflatable tube men dancing at a strip club is very, very funny. Mashing the buttons on your controller while having limited control of your wacky inflatable tube guy is less fun. I don’t really know. I want to love Strip Tubes, but it’s missing a little something to push it over the edge into greatness. Some varying dramatic camera angles? Perhaps some crowd interaction? I’m not really sure what is missing, but I feel like something is. Strip Tubes has a good blueprint. I just feel like it’s missing some pizazz, some feng shui, some razzle dazzle to bring it from “Mildly Humorous” to “ Legitimately Funny”. 

At least I no longer have to imagine what it would look like if Sam took up stripping - though I will have to mentally adjust my dreams and fantasies (for accuracy).

**Recommend: If you’re watching this more than 4 seconds in the future, sorry about the copyright strike.** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: Does this include the time it took to get two controllers connected without them moving my mouse?**
