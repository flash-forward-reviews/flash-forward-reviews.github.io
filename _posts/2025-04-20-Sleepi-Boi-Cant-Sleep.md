## Sam's Take:

I like that you can drag the camera around to see the 3D pixel graphics, but I’m sick and kept losing track of where the character was. Can vomiting be from allergies?

I mean can you vomit because of allergies?

Holy hell my head hurts.

## Skeeter's Take:

Sleepi Boi Can’t Sleep is pretty cozy. I like the rain sounds, and the late night vibes. 

But I don’t think it’s Sam’s virus allergy-ridden brain that’s responsible for continuously losing the character.

I’m not sure if allergies can make you vomit, but I checked WebMD and it said it could be a symptom of cancer. 

Hope you feel better, Sam!
