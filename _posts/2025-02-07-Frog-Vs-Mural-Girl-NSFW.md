## Skeeter's Take: 

Well, we’ve got a bit of an odd one today. Play as FROG. Face off against Mural Girl. Use your sticky frog tongue to lick the oddly placed bandages on her shirt to break it. Lick enough bandages and you are rewarded with pastie covered boobies. 

What’s a “Mural Girl”? I’m not 100% sure, but my best guess is that making the woman a “mural” was a good excuse for not modeling her in 3D:

I’m honestly at a loss for words here. The above sentences don’t feel real. I feel like I pulled them from a fever dream I had when I was 16. As far as porn games go, thankfully this was very tame, but damn, I cannot shake the weird feeling it left me with. It’s caked in this cutesy art style which is really juxtaposed against what’s actually happening in the game. Just look at the frog:

This adorable little fucker is a sexual deviant that likes licking bandages and tearing clothing off of wall-painted women, and that just doesn’t sit right. What a bizarre experience. Perhaps we humans have ventured too far into the realm of fantasy. Maybe it’s time to reel that in a little bit. 

But hey, I still got a sub 100 second time.

## Sam's Take:

Pulling a painted woman’s top using the tongue of a 3D frog wasn’t really what I needed tonight. There’s just something about this game being so silly that makes the horniness more uncomfortable than a normal porn game. With a normal porn game you know what you’re signing up for, but this was someone making a 3D platformer primarily, then adding boobs to it. I honestly can’t possibly imagine the thought process that went into the making of this game.

What’s even more strange is that it’s perfectly functional. All the obstacles are dodgeable, there’s little animations between boss phases, effort was put into this. It’s not a shitpost that someone threw boobs into, it’s not a porn game... I don’t know what it is. I’m fully stumped by this one guys. Also I got fucking owned by Skeeter:

My wife watched me play. She said she doesn’t like it.
