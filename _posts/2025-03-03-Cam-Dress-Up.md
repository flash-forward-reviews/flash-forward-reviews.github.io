## Skeeter's Take:

Cam dress-up is the quintessential Newgrounds dress-up game. This feels directly ripped from 2006. It features all the standard Newgrounds dress-up game tropes - an MS Paint original character only wearing their undies, MS paint clothing that can be dragged and dropped onto the character, and a looping background music track. Dress-up Cam with his MS paint closet! Take a photo of it and post it on your Myspace! Whoo-hoo!

Obviously, my disdain for the titular Newgrounds dress-up game needs no further explanation at this point. While this does suck, and I do not have fun dragging every bit of clothing available to clutter the character (No, I will not change my playstyle), I had to go to the rules for the Flash Forward 2025 game jam. 

Since Cam dress-up so perfectly encapsulates the Newgrounds dress-up game, I figured the Flash Forward 2025 game jam would mention something in its rules saying that all submissions had to follow some guideline that these games had to be made in the classic Flash style - almost like an homage to the decades past. Cam dress-up would fit perfectly in that “Yeah, I know dress-up games are dumb, but there were so many of these in the past that I had to make one for this celebration of Flash!” category. 

And while there is no rule that restricts creators, it does seem to be the idea and spirit behind this game jam:

And you know what? I think Cam dress-up is the perfect game to celebrate the anniversary of Flash. It really does feel pulled directly from an alternative universe where only Newgrounds dress-up games exist. 

So, if I were judging this based on the Jam theme, I’d say they nailed it!

That being said, the dev still decided to make a dress-up game when the Meet and Fuck series was ripe for the picking! What were they thinking???
