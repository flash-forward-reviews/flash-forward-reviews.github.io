## Sam's Take:

Skeeter is without computer again, so he tried to get a bunch of mobile games to work, but none of them did. We thought about taking a picture of the screen showing it couldn’t load, but we’ve done that joke a couple times now, so instead, we are reviewing Skeeter’s new dog.

Skeeter has not met the dog, but they put down the deposit. I think he looks cute and terrified.

UPDATE: She is available around Nov. 5th. I think she’s a cutie, but I agree that she does look terrified of the camera. She’s a Toy Aussie.

**Recommend: Yes**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 90%**

**Time Played: None**

My dog is... I don't know. I haven't met her. I hope she is cute and intelligent and a sweetheart but I've never met her.

**Recommend: Yes**
