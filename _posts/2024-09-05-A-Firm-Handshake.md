## Skeeter's Take:

Here I am\
I am a man\
Here I am\
To shake my hand

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img/blob/main/img/afh2.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

Here I am\
Hand in hand\
Here I am\
Myself is another man

Here I am\
When I shake hand\
Myself will follow me\
All across the land

Here I am\
I’ve shook so many hands\
Here I am\
With my army of mans

Here I am\
I lost my mans\
Here I am\
In sumo Frogger land

Here I am\
But there they go\
Nobody wants to shake my hand no mo

Here I am\
I awake in bed\
I’m all alone\
And I’m feeling sad

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img/blob/main/img/afh8.png?raw=true" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

Here I am\
Hand in hand\
It’s all OK\
Because I’ve got a friend

## Sam's Take:

A Firm Handshake is top tier. It’s so top tier that I almost don’t want to talk about it for fear of ruining its surprises. The animation is hilarious, the sounds are all excellent, and at one point my wife looked over at my screen, and then proceeded to watch me play the whole thing.

I loved this game so much that I donated the suggested $2 for it, and I NEVER donate the suggested $2.

We will be checking out [Torfi’s](https://torfi.itch.io/){:target="_blank"} other games. That’s all I want to say about this game. It’s like fifteen minutes long, free, and delightful. Saying anything else might spoil some nice little surprises. Just play it, enjoy thineself!

**Recommend: Absolutely**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Probably not this game, but def their other games%**

**Time Played: 15 Minutes**
