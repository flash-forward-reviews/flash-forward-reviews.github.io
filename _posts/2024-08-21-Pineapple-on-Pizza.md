## Skeeter's Take:

Oh man, Pineapple on Pizza is going to be a tough one to review for me. I had an absolute blast with this game, but the ending completely re-contextualizes the entire game, including the title, and it is at the core of what makes this game amazing. I don’t want to deprive anyone of experiencing this game for themselves, so I will not be spoiling the ending. I think this is the kind of game that is better to go into with little to no context. Sam might end up spoiling as I feel this game is hard/near impossible to talk about without discussing the ending. I’ll leave that up to him, however, and give you guys the set up: 

Pineapple on Pizza sets out with a very clear mission statement:

This is important. I cannot tell you why, but just know that it is.

I awoke on a beautiful sunny island. I was surrounded by a bunch of happy, dancing islanders that seem to be celebrating!

A whimsical music track plays in the background. At this point, I am absolutely smiling ear to ear. The combination of the wacky music and immediately being met with a bunch of silly islanders goofily dancing had me cracking up. It’s funny. But then, it kept getting funnier to me. As I continued to walk around the island, it became very clear - it’s not just a group of islanders dancing - it’s the whole entire island. Every single one of them.

Upon entering the circle I got an achievement:

This is when I realized this game has the best achievements. Almost all of them entail approaching something:

Amazing. I truly feel as though I have achieved something. Thank you Pineapple on Pizza. 
As I continued to explore the island, I noticed something etched into the back of a stone in the middle of the village:

I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about!

I’ll leave it on that teaser. Go play this for yourself. It’s very short, but very funny and clever. I was grinning ear to ear the entire time, but upon the ending being revealed I was damn near giving this game a standing ovation. I’m not joking. I was sitting here in my room alone loudly clapping at my computer screen and giggling like an idiot. This is one of my favorite games I’ve played this year, and I’m not even being ironic. 

**Recommend: I love Pineapple on Pizza. I cannot recommend this enough. I wish we had a Highly Recommended: Seal of Approval award or something like that, because I’d give this game 2 of them. And while I love Pineapple on Pizza, I’m just alright with pineapple on pizza.  I normally pick the pineapple off and eat it, then eat the slice… (send complaints to skeeteronthemic@gmail.com)**

## Sam's Take:

I am fucking stunlocked. If you total up both of our review projects, we’ve played a game a day for a total of 478 days. When we started our old project years ago, there was always that hope that we’d find the gold nugget. We’d hit that random button and a new favorite would come out. Obviously the odds were against us, but we were spinning the wheel 365 times, surely one had to be a hit.

We played some fine games for that project, but I’ve never gone back to a single one outside of [Pink Alien Transplant](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-100){:target="_blank"}, which like... not to show how the sausage is made here but, our love of Pink Alien Transplant is obviously a joke, that game is hilarious.

The games for this project have overall been much better. Obviously some we had already played, or were already excited about ([Dread Delusion](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-14){:target="_blank"}, [Infinite Fusion](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-12){:target="_blank"}), but even the random games were faring much better, (I don’t know what the difference between itch.io and Newgrounds is, but something is going on there). Still, after over 450 days of reviews, I had basically forgotten that initial hope of clicking on a random game and finding something truly excellent, something that I’d send to my friends and unironically beg them to play.

And yet, here we are.

Pineapple on Pizza made me laugh for 10 minutes, say, “wait... no way”, then laugh for another 10 minutes after the game had ended. This game goes so hard that I barely even know how to express myself. The song in the background of this game has a two hit punctuation at the end of each phrase. BAM BAM! Something like half the dancers have a special animation for just these hits. Some clap twice on the BAM BAM, some jerk their arms around, I spent several minutes looking for which NPCs were going to react to the BAMs. THIS MOTHERFUCKER FEEDS BIRDS ON BEAT!

I have never heard of the [Alva Majo](https://www.alvamajo.com/){:target="_blank"} guy, but we’re playing every game he’s ever played. I’m not going to say anymore, you already read Skeeter’s review! GO PLAY THIS THING! THIS IS NOT A JOKE, I GENUINELY LOVE IT!

I think what we’ll do is keep this a spoiler free review, then probably discuss this game again, but put spoiler warnings on it. We need to talk about the later half of this game, but now is not the time. I refuse to take the experience of playing this away from all of you.

Play Pineapple on Pizza. Play it right now.

**Recommend: I’ve never recommended anything more**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 90%**

**Time Played: 478 days worth of reviews**
