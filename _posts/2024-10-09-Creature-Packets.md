## Sam's Take:

I’m pretty mixed on Creature Packets. While the concept of creating live animals by microwaving creatures certainly has creep-factor, there just isn’t any sort of gameplay or pressure of any kind in this game. The loop is pretty simple, and order appears on the screen:

You get the packets you need out of the vending machine:

You use the blender to combine creatures you have into new creatures:

Then you microwave those creatures and send em off:

You might think the challenge of the game comes from trying to find out what creatures need to be combined to make new ones, but there are notes all around the room telling you those answers. You might think the challenge is getting every order in on time, but there’s no timer. This game boils down to being a to-do list with creepy atmosphere. There’s a whole three strikes you’re out system which implies some sort of challenge, like keeping up with new laws and everything that could be wrong with a passport in Papers Please, but you’d have to be asleep to miss any of the orders.

I don’t think every game needs to be challenging, but if you don’t have challenge, you’ve got to replace it with something, otherwise it’s just tasks. Creature Packets is a cool idea looking for a proper system to play in. Having the job of creating creatures with vending machine packets is good, we just need one more layer.
