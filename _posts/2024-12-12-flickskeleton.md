## Sam's Take:

It took me a bit to figure out what the hell was going on with this game, but I THINK I’ve got it locked down. The game itself is simple. You choose head/chest/arm/leg parts for your skeleton, choose a color palette, then just look at your sick new skeleton. Look at mine!!

WOW PRETTY SICK!

There are some advanced options that work as a scaled down Paint tool, but that’s about it. What confused me was when I clicked on the link at the bottom of the game that said “update”:

Clicking this took me to a [different URL](https://kool.tools/flickguy/){:target="_blank"} with the same functionality, but when I refreshed it, I had a different thing to customize that wasn’t a skeleton at all:

So wait, what gives? Well I checked out the cool tools website, and it seems like the creator of the editing tool and the creator of the game we are reviewing are totally different people. Basically, the cool tools person (who goes by [Candle](https://kool.tools/){:target="_blank"} online) made a program where you could add your own images to make a character creation/dress up game. Basically a very specific game engine.

So then our game maker, [Rose](https://modernmodron.itch.io/){:target="_blank"} took it upon themselves to make their own using a cool skeleton.

So this is just some small community creators sharing stuff and making more stuff. My skeleton looked cool. I had a fine time.
