## Sam's Take:

It’s a puzzle game where you can play as a cat, a girl, or a combination of the two (which is a faerie I guess). Each character can only go through specific doors and you just have to figure out how to get to the end of the maze using your ability to split into two people then re-combine later.

Nothing spectacular going on here, but it’s functional, has an ending, and I actually had to use my brain like... two times.

It’s fine. The only reason we played it is because my friend Phil said I should google for a game called “tiggle biddies”. I guess I should thank my lucky stars that this is the game we reviewed.

**Recommend: Tiggle**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Biddies**

**Time Played: 4evr**

## Skeeter's Take:

It’s ok Sam, I found Tiggle Bitties YouTube Channel:

I’ve got to admit, I had more fun with the time I spent playing Tiggle than I did watching this 11 second cover of a Sam Smith song.

**Recommend: No, not really**

**Replay Percentage Chance:**

**Time Played: The wonderful thing about Tiggles, is that I’m the only one**
