## Skeeter's Take:

awesome calculator promises some very big things:

FIVE different operations including exponentiation! Wow!

Upon loading in, I was met with a beautiful rainbow-themed calculator that is pretending like it’s running on Windows XP - it even has the iconic grassy meadow background:

A 4-bar piano measure plays on loop. I input my numbers (I am limited to two 2-digit integers) and choose my operator. As I hit enter, the copyright free Dubstep music drops its beat and goes wild with the robot sounds. My answer appears before me:

“But skeeter” I can hear none of you asking, “What about the easter eggs the description promised?”
Don’t worry fan! I diligently searched around, and using my elite gamer logic I was able to discover this:

“But skeeter” the ghostly voices in my head call out yet again, “What is that thing?”

Yeah, I have no idea either. awesome.

awesome calculator is stupid. But it knows it's stupid. It boasts about being awesome, yet only supports 2-digit numbers and basic mathematical functions. It fully embraces the early 2000/10s aesthetic (it even describes itself as “epic”). Sure, using Windows XP as a fake desktop is nothing new by any means, but this could have just been the calculator by itself. This paired with the dubstep music, the comic sans, and the word art graphics really bring the whole package together. I also really appreciate that the dev took the time to loop the start of the dubstep song, and have the beat drop once the player clicks answer. It really is the punchline. It’s simple, but I found it really funny. I don’t think I would have liked this or even laughed had that small detail not been included. It’s remarkable this brings it over the line for me. awesome calculator is by all means a shitpost - but it’s a good shitpost. It’s not overly edgy and it doesn’t punch down. It is just intentionally not convenient or useful and juxtaposes that by claiming it’s amazing, incredible, and awesome.

Epic!

**Recommend: It’s hard to say I “recommend” this game as I think enjoyment of this will vary greatly depending on the person, but we (Sam and I) have seen enough shitpost Newgrounds games at this point and I think this is one of the better ones we’ve played. Plus, it does function as a real calculator. I challenge you: Next time you have the very specific circumstance where you need to calculate a simple math equation that only uses two numbers between 0 - 99, instead of pulling out your calculator or your phone or doing it in your head, pull up Newgrounds on your browser, wait the 4-5 minutes it takes for awesome calculator to load up, crank up the speakers on your PC and watch your confused co-workers reaction as your answer reveals and the epic dubstep beat drops.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 3%**

**Time Played: 5 minutes (not including load time)**

## Sam's Take:

I am alone in my office crying with laughter as the sweet sounds of [DEAF KEV’s Invincible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2X5mJ3HDYE){:target="_blank"} blast endlessly into my headphones.

I give this game a standing ovation, and 1 + 1 thumbs up.

Wait, how many thumbs is that? Let me check...

BWOOOOOOBWEEEBEEEDOOO WUBBB WAAAA WAAAA
