## Sam's Take:

Why is there an Indonesian Oreo ad on Itch.io? Was this a real ad saved to the site? Did someone make this for fun?

There are some things we just are not supposed to understand.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 30 Seconds** 

## Skeeter's Take:

Even an Indonesian Oreo advertisement game couldn’t make red velvet Oreos sound good. 

Side note, I don’t know if I really like Red Velvet. I’ve tried it many times, but it always just tastes like food coloring and vanilla. Like, it’s fine. I’ll eat it. But it’s not something I go seek out. I’d rather just have a vanilla cake or a confetti cake. Maybe I’m alone in this. 

At least Oreo Ads captures the essence of Red Velvet in its gameplay.

**Recommend: I’ll let mattlasvalentine say it all.**
