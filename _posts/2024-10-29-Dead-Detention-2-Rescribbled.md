## Skeeter's Take:

I had a fun time with the real-time format for yesterday, and since this is the second installment in the series I’m going to let it ride again today. 

00:14 - I gave into the impulse to click “YES” on touchscreen controls this time and it just removes the mouse cursor. Restarting the game. 

00:30 - Screenshot acquired. Menu and title screen all look the same. 

01:15 - Holy Hell the game saved my audio settings. I didn’t even notice there was no loud blasting music until I went to adjust it. How does it know?? 

02:30 - Playing on Easy again and, much like Miley Cyrus, I can’t stop and we won’t stop. 
 
04:30 - Well, this isn’t starting out the way I was expecting. There are two science nerds in a building talking about the virus they unleashed on the city.

They claim it’s for the “greater good”, but that seems dubious. 
Blue Hair doctor has the same shade of blue as our protagonist and has a kid that goes to school in the city. There isn’t a shred of doubt in my mind that this is the parent of ABC (which I’m just realizing was supposed to be an acronym for “Annoying Complainy Boy” which would be “ACB” not “ABC”, but it’s too late to change my past. We’re just going to have to move past this).

10:00 - I WAS RIGHT

11:57 - We are back where we left off yesterday with the protagonist and her sister running away from a fire the player character (ABC) started.

17:26 - I failed the Warioware mini-game for this screenshot:

19:25 - The door is locked lol, they are so fucked. 

22:35 - I am picking the negative wimp-out option every time. Naomi can take care of this. 

24:00 - She could not, in fact, kick the door down. I placed my fate in the wrong hands. I bet my nemesis will save the day. Calling it now!

25:00 - ABC doesn’t want to look for a way out of the burning building because of his twisted ankle. I’m flipping to Team Sora. She’s the true voice of the audience:

27:00 - It seems the janitor closed up early, because every friggin door in this school is locked. 

29:23 - We found a vent. It’s the perfect escape in the event of a fire! Let’s hope there are no exhaust fans running. I lost the “Not It’ game and now ABC is crawling into a vent like the useless air he is. 

30:40 - I’m an idiot, turns out it was just for who was going first.  We all in here.

32:20 -

33:45 - What do you reckon this says?

{% include figure.html image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/refs/heads/main/img/2dedet8.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

“I AM KIRA”? 

35:10 - Either the fire hasn’t spread much, or the routers are flame-retardant because we still have Wi-Fi baby! Enough to look up a news article about a virus outbreak in New York City (ladies and gentleman, we have a location). The city is being evacuated. 

38:15 - Wi-Fi waited for us to read the article before it shut down, so that was nice

40:08  - They are considering riding it out the incoming Zombie Apocalypse out in the School. As far as supplies are concerned, it’s not a terrible idea. They probably have a nurse station, cafeteria food, a gym for exercise/entertainment. If only they weren’t three high schoolers, they might stand a chance. 

42:10 - Even ABC has forgotten about the Attack on Titan premiere. He hasn’t even brought it up one time. That’s how you know the situation is serious!

43:25 - CAUSE THIS IS THRILLER, THRILLER NIGHTS.

45:24 - Badass Bow-Wielding Teacher was not on my bingo list

{% include figure.html image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/refs/heads/main/img/2dedet10.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

47:05 - Virus started at the school? Wonder if ABC did something unwittingly. 

48:00 - ABC is brainstorming again. Have we learned nothing???

49:41 -

50:19  - TEACHER GOT BIT. I REPEAT, TEACHER GOT BIT. I THINK WE JUST ACQUIRED A NEW BOW BUT LOST A TEACHER. GOOD TRADE.

51:20 - A roof key?? What about the fucking weapon?? GIVE US THE WEAPON!!!

{% include figure.html image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/refs/heads/main/img/2dedet13.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

53:04 -

Great. She just created a zombie with a bow. That’s a new genotype of zombie we aren’t ready for. 

56:54 - We made it to the roof. ABC is the only one with any service and he uses it to call his Mommy who is a science person. The city evacuated without us, confirmed. 

58:53 - The game leaves us on a cliff-hanger. Protag girl stares off into the distance looking horrified as she yells at ABC to look. The game fades out… 

Post-Game: 
There’s not much to say in a wrap up since this is a continuation of yesterday’s game. It’s the same paper-puppet style, same characters and it picks up nearly where we left off yesterday. 
I think I found the specific references the main character made yesterday more funny than anything I saw today. 

**Recommend: I fear my ironic investment may be turning to real investment**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Episode 3?**

**Time Played: 59:53** 

## Sam's Take:

BRO

FUCKING HOW?!

{% include figure.html image="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/refs/heads/main/img/2dedet16.jpg" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

It’s the same game except the minigames are much harder to immediately understand. I had to retry most of them, but it’s not a huge problem. It almost turns it into a puzzle game, which also happens in a chapter of Alula Falling...

But we’ll get there. It is not time yet.

The game is still painfully earnest, and I have to respect it for that. I share Skeeter’s feeling that I’m now invested, but I mean that exactly as it is. I’m not excited. I’m not looking forward to it. I’ve literally put time into it, and want to see how it ends due to some sort of sunk cost fallacy. Plus Skeeter’s new review style allows me to basically say nothing since he describes the whole plot. 

Anyway, here is the funniest line from this episode IMO, said after the teacher pulls out a bow and starts fucking shit up:

**Recommend: Nope**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Episode 3?**

**Time Played: 11 Min, 28.65 Seconds**
