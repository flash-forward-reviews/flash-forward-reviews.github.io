## Skeeter's Take:

Fortnite2 seems like it was made by a kid in middle/high school to show to a group of friends who’s inside joke consists mostly of saying “Amongus” and “Sans Undertale”. Look,  I’m not trying to disparage anyone’s interest or humor. I grew up in the era where [lolcats](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lolcats){:target="_blank"} and quoting [Borat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borat){:target="_blank"} were the funniest things to us, so I’m basically a comedic expert… NOT.

I’m not going to sugar coat my crotchety-ness - Fortnite2 is what I would consider “Zoomer Humor”. I don’t really like that term or the other self-categorizing era terms. (OMG Look at me, I am SUCH a Millennial. What’s your star sign? Do you have any puppers or doggos? You need to understand, this is a [Disney](https://www.disney.com/){:target="_blank"} household, OK?). I do think it is an appropriate term to illustrate a very specific kind of humor from a very specific point in time (AKA the big P - 2020-2023).

Much like the real [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/){:target="_blank"}, Fortnite2 is jam full of IPs that I barely recognize. It also has photos of random memes plastered about the walls, which look more like random sprays in a [TF2](https://www.teamfortress.com/){:target="_blank"} [2Fort](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/2Fort){:target="_blank"} server than anything coherent.

It’s got [Sans](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Sans){:target="_blank"} from [Undertale](https://undertale.com/){:target="_blank"} [T-Posing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-pose){:target="_blank"} and constantly floating at you. If you get touched by him, you lose the game, and are met with a sad [Spongebob meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sad-spongebob-spunchbop){:target="_blank"}.

There’s a giant [Five Nights at Freddy's](https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_Wiki){:target="_blank"} statue and the whole floor texture is a Mini-Golf game green grid.

Even the music is a meme - I wish I didn’t recognize the song as the “Five Nights at Freddy’s” song, but my stupid ass friend KYLE keeps fucking SINGING it in our [DISCORD](https://discord.com/){:target="_blank"} and is the sole reason I can even IDENTIFY it. 

Kyle you’re [banned](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/banned){:target="_blank"}. 

I’ve never heard the real song, but I can’t imagine the real one features a chain-smoking sea lion “[Scat-Manning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8){:target="_blank"}” every instrument with his [electrolarynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolarynx){:target="_blank"}. (Secret Skeeter Note: It doesn’t - I actually found the version used in this game by accident while looking for the original song while editing. Turns out it was another meme video, but not going to lie, this guy SHREDS it! I take it all back):

There are also countless [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/){:target="_blank"} statues and references, and just to top it all off, your main goal is to collect 13 photos of anime kids. I know it sounds kind of creepy when I say it in that context, (which, I mean, fair) but they seem more like pixel art sprites for another game more than anything. Odd choice to collect essentially 2D objects in a 3D space. 

This is just a lot of writing to say: 

I really didn’t like this and didn’t find any of the humor funny. This is mostly referential and [XD Random](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-so-random-lol-so-random-so-random){:target="_blank"} humor, of which the things they are referencing I am only surface level familiar with (except [Undertale](https://undertale.com/){:target="_blank"}, that game did kind of rule).

 I realize that this is my fault for choosing a game called “Fortnite2” to review for today. I pretty much got what was advertised on the tin. 

This game probably made someone laugh, and I’m glad for that. Keep making stupid meme games, oh child. Don’t let the world tell you that you can’t! You might get kicked when you're down, but you must keep fighting. You must keep memeing! It is your memestiny!

Now get off my apartment’s lawn.

## Sam's Take:

I think [Skeeter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-qZGXXXsro){:target="_blank"} may have [forgot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otdgj8fBQxc){:target="_blank"} an important [lesson](https://web.archive.org/web/20220424135129/http://postpostproduction.com/flash-in-the-pan/verses-for-everyday-life/){:target="_blank"}:
