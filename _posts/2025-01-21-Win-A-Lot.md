## Skeeter's Take:

At least Win-a-Lot isnâ€™t just some mobile trash slot machine game looking to advertise to you, steal your data, and try to make money from you. 

There is a locking system where you can lock any of the columns and spin again. You get 3 spins with a lock on the board until you have to spin without any locks. This makes it pretty easy to win, so I guess Win-a-Lot lives up to its name at least.
