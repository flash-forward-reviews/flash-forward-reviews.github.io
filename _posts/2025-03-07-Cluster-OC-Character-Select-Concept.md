## Sam's Take:

It’s a character select screen and nothing else. This is fine, you can make a part of a game and post it on a website, I have no problem with this. My issue is this is the second highest rated game in the Flash Forward game jam.

There’s a voice line for each character and they are all embarrassing. My favorite is probably the gun girl that says, “I’ve still got a couple of bullets with your tits’ names on them”. Embarrassing.

WHAT CONCEPT MAN? IT’S A CHARACTER SELECT SCREEN, THIS SHIT HAS BEEN AROUND! WHAT IS ANYONE ON THIS FUCKING WEBSITE TALKING ABOUT?!!?!?!?

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: Fuck off**

## Skeeter's Take:

There’s a certain kind of dedication that is needed to painstakingly recreate every character from your character select screen in an All Elite Wrestling game. I’m not sure if I should be impressed or afraid:
