## Sam's Take:

Wedding Fight has very little value outside of the auditory assault it provides. The bride throws the bouquet behind her, you try to judge where it’s going to land and snatch it before the other brides do. If they catch it, you lose. If you catch it, you win.

There are two things that stand out about this game though. The first is the sound. Outside of the blaring wedding song techno remixes, all the women scream before the bouquet is thrown. In context I think it is supposed to be a scream of excitement, but in reality it’s a horror scream that is twice as loud as everything else in this game. Haunting. Secondly... look at the controls for this game:

There’s a “hit” button as well as a “fight” button. If you press these, there is indeed a punch sound effect, and you can hear your character throwing elbows... but as far as I can tell it does nothing. If someone else catches the bouquet, you can punch and fight all you want and you still lose. If you catch it, there’s no need to fight, you’ve already won. Maybe you think you use it to give yourself space before the catch happens, but it didn’t seem to have any effect there either.

Maybe this will be the time Skeeter figures out how a mechanic works and proves me to be the dummy, but I’m stumped by the fightless Wedding Fight.

## Skeeter's Take:

Well, sorry to disappoint Sam, but I wasn’t even able to win. I was nearly convinced that there was no way to win and that the joke being made was if you catch the bouquet (or don’t) you’ll lose anyway (Marriage, amirite???). I swear I caught the bouquet at least twice but still got the lose screen, but maybe there was someone standing directly behind my character, perfectly mimicking my movements. I’m thinking this shadow person actually caught the bouquet, hence my loss. 

For me, the “fight” button didn’t seem to do anything, so the only tool I had at my disposal was the “Hit” button (which, unlike Sam, actually worked for me). All the “Hit” button does is shove the other wedding guests a small distance, but it also displaces the player character a small distance as well. For me, this usually resulted in my character shoving a few of the guests out of the way, only to be moved further away from the bouquet than the people I shoved. And that empty space I created would be almost immediately filled by the guests I didn’t happen to hit. This rendered the “Hit” button wholly useless tech for me. I ended up going with the strategy of “Stand under bouquet and hope it hits me before anyone else”. 

And well… You know how that went:

I like the concept. There’s something silly about fighting for a bouquet at a wedding. Unfortunately, Wedding Fight can’t survive on concept alone and the gameplay aspect is a little wonky and undercooked. 

But hey, the main menu actually slaps:
