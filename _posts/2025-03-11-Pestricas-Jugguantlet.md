## Skeeter's Take:

Fun fact: Sam and I took a juggling class together in college. 

It was Pass/No Pass. 

We both passed. 

Still couldn’t top out over 48 consecutive ball juggles in this game. 

Since I am already forcing my trip down memory lane upon you, I’d like to present an homage to a video from our last project that I’m almost certain only Sam has seen:

**Recommend: It’s actually pretty fun**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 10 Minutes**

## Sam's Take:

God, Skeeter’s videos were always fucking bangers. Allow me to demonstrate:
