## Skeeter's Take:

Aww, shit. Snap, Crackle, Pop, my digits! This here old mollusk is of the librarian snooze. I’m saying this is a Type Gun type game type beat on god fr fr. This porky-waggling electro-screen game has no pool. More less pool than another. Arizona sledding, ya dig?

**Recommend: No type beat**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0% type beat**

**Time Played: 1 minute type beat**

## Sam's Take:

I was really hoping for an airplane based typing tutor on this one. Some real [Typing of the Dead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/246580/The_Typing_of_The_Dead_Overkill/){:target="_blank"} type shit. Turns out it’s just a lil pew pew type game. Move up, pew pew. Move down, pew pew. I left the church when I was six years old, I don’t need any more pews.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 30 Seconds**
