## Sam's Take:

Moida Mansion is a Tiger-Electronics-Style game where you walk around a procedurally generated mansion and attempt to save your friends. It seems to be created with the same sprite/button limitations that one of those games would have (ie. only one sprite per space on screen, and only a few buttons to keep track of).

While I’d assume those old machines couldn’t handle the procedural generation (though I’m no expert), it is cool to see how deep you could theoretically go with screen limitations like this.

I’ll be honest though, I had a hard time understanding the instructions of the game at first. You’re able to search any object, but there is no point for most things. When you ACTUALLY need to search something, there will be a visual and auditory que. Searching pointlessly causes the monster to appear and kill you. One of the few parts of the game that requires paying attention is seeing the monster’s head peek into a window or door frame and walking in the other direction.

So I was confused at first, then when I figured it out, it was just walking from room to room waiting for the next event to happen. Eventually I gathered my crew and headed on out. It said I only collected 3 out of 4, so maybe there’s another secret somewhere, but it seem like a pretty simple affair overall.

Honestly, I might have stopped playing after my initial confusion, had I not noticed that this game was made by Lucas Pope, creator of Papers Please and Return of the Obra Dinn. Even after figuring it all out I’m not super thrilled. It’s the best Tiger Electronics game I’ve ever played, yes, but that’s not the highest bar. It seems like Lucas Pope thought “could I make a better game under these restrictions” and the answer was yes. It’s a fine free game, but don’t go in expecting Obra Dinn.
