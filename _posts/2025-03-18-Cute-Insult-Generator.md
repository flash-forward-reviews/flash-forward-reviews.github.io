## Skeeter's Take:

I wasn’t really feeling super motivated today. It’s been a long 46 weeks, and I didn’t feel like starting another review. I do struggle with procrastinating, and am generally pretty lazy, so I was extremely excited to see today’s game pop up. 

“Cute Insult Generator” seemingly reached out through the veil, extending a hand that promised to help. 

See, CIG touts itself as a motivation tool:

And what says “Motivation” like the most incoherent string of words ever thrown together, and a picture of an anime woman!

What it’s motivating you to do is never mentioned. Something tells me the dev has a specific thing they intend to motivate with this game, and something else tells me they probably don’t need the motivation to do it. 

There are two different buttons to generate insults; “Get Insulted” and “Generate Insult for a Friend”

I cannot for the life of me figure out the difference between these two buttons. I took a small sample from both buttons and all my theories fell apart, and I’m no closer to understanding. For example, here is an image generated from “Get Insulted”:

And here’s one from the “Generate Insult for a Friend” :

Yeah, no fucking clue. They are the same. I think the buttons are a joke. 

I don’t watch a lot of anime (I basically just watch Cowboy Bebop on repeat), so I have no idea who any of these characters are, but it is a little concerning that a handful of them look like literal children.

Which is odd when these photos are just mixed in with photos like this:

I started this review fully expecting to make a “At least I found the motivation to finish. And I completed my review too!” joke, but that feels in pretty poor taste now.

I really wrote myself into a corner with this one. I certainly hope no adult, legal, of age anime women want to send me an insulting message for motivation to my email at iamsamcain@gmail.com. That would just be the worst. 

**Recommend: God no**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 5 minutes**

## Sam's Take:

As I type this, Skeeter is writing yet another paragraph about Cute Insult Generator.

I don’t know what to say, this game has nothing but random insults next to anime girls. I don’t know what could possibly be motivating Skeeter to write so-

...oh.

**Recommend: To Skeeter**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Depends if I can choose the game before Skeeter does**

**Time Played: I have to save all these images and upload them to Github for the site now**
