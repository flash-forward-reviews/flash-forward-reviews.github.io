**Recommend: YES, the balance in this game is honestly pretty good, and getting the good ending took some practice**

**Replay Percentage Chance: KING CROC%**

**Time Played: 7.5 Hours**

## Skeeter's Take:

Wild Animal Sports Day is Bird at his best. There are 8 mostly functional mini-games all featuring the goofy 3D modeled animals from the Wild Animalverse:

The mini-games are infinitely more enjoyable when you get to watch these goofy fuckers flip around:

As Sam displayed, there are a lot of funny bugs to discover along the way. I feel that these really enhance the overall Paul Bird experience. 

I can appreciate the mini-games - there’s a good effort put in there and I’m not miserable when playing them (except for that damn diving game). However, I would be lying if the sole reason I ever launch WASD is to slog my way through the mini-games just to get to the ultimate reward: the best bad ending I’ve ever seen in a game. 

That’s correct, It’s KING CROC
