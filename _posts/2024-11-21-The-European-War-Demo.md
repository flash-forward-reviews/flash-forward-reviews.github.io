## Sam's Take:

At first The European War (DEMO) is completely impenetrable. The little text box flashes “WAR” then a bunch of countries cycle through it. Sometimes the text says “yes” sometimes it says “no”. The map will change color, you won’t know why. You’ll try clicking on everything, none of it does anything.

After staring for a while though, I finally got it. I think it flashes “war”, “alliance”, “independence”, or “peace” at the start, then rolls two countries, then decides if that thing happens. For example “War, Sweden, Russia, Yes” would mean that Sweden and Russia go to war, making both the same color (I don’t know how it chooses who wins the war... but one thing at a time).

So far I’ve only seen “war” happen. Maybe that’s the (DEMO) part of the game. It’s just a simulation that randomly runs on its own. I honestly had an okay time trying to figure out what was going on, but now that I’ve told you, I don’t think there’s much to get out of it. Sorry about that.

EDIT: AFTER RELOADING I GOT THIS ERROR:

## Skeeter's Take:

Sorry, I fell asleep yesterday and FORGOT to do one of the things I do daily (these reviews). 

I played The European War. I read Sam’s breakdown of The European War. I do not feel closer to understanding the point of The European War. I know this is the demo, so maybe there will be some player interaction added later. Currently, it feels like I’m watching a digital Witch try to scry through the veil to predict the next global conflict. 

I’ve decided I’m just going to use this as a European travel guide. 

So far, I’m heading to Portugal and Spain. I just need to start a little war between them. 
Thankfully, Geography is on my side. I’ll just need to utilize a quick Wikipedia search to find out how I can heighten tensions between the two countries.
