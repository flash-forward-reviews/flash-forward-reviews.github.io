## Skeeter's Take:

Normally, when we see car-centric online free games, they tend to focus on either racing, customizing your cars, or a combination of both. 

Time to Park approaches the genre in a rather unorthodox way. Normally, the player would be doing the fun, dangerous, and illegal things you can normally do in a racing game but not real life. Instead, in Time to Park, you are tasked with the exhilarating thrill of parking a car correctly!

What a great idea, take my already very real anxiety of parking my boat of a car, amplify it, and make it the core game mechanic. This is essentially a horror game for me, as far as I am concerned. 

And boy, this game is harsher on judging my parking than the guy that gave me my first driving test.

That’s not considered parked! I am slightly out of line with the arbitrary box the game has placed in between the two parking lines, so it’s decided that’s not a good enough parking job. Try again, Bozo!

This whole game fills me with a terrible anxiety that I haven’t felt from a game in many, many years, so kudos on that!

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 6 minutes** 

## Sam's Take:

If you can beat level 6 of this game, I’ll review any game you choose. Whatever you want, as long as you want. No limits. Level 6 of this game is infuriating. I’m FUMING right now.

WHAT KIND OF PARKING HELL IS THIS. I hate CrazyGames, and I need to start picking games faster to stop Skeeter from doing this to me.

**Recommend: Fuck you**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Fuck you%**

**Time Played: 15 Fucking Minutes**
