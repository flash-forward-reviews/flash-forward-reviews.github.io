## Sam's Take:

For the next three reviews, Skeeter will be out of town for a family gathering. Due to the fact that his family are indeed Mole People, we are not sure if he will have internet access during this time. For this reason, he has picked out three games that run on Android and will be playing/reviewing them, however he may not be able to get those reviews for me so I can post them.

Basically, if you are reading this recently after I write it, Skeeter’s review MIGHT be a “review pending” template that will be backfilled once he’s back from the mole-hole (that’s what they call it idk man). If you’re reading this in the future, then it is possible the Skeeter’s next 3 reviews were written without seeing mine or vice versa.

Mario Kart Mobile test is so boring that I’d rather write about the logistics of our next three reviews. Tap left to move left, tap right to move right, avoid koopas on the road. It feels like the developer was just trying to see if they could get their controls to work on a mobile device. Like some sort of test.

Oh.

Oh I see.

Umm...

Did y’all like the font I chose to make the cover image for this game?

**Recommend: Parchment Font**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 47 Seconds**

## Skeeter's Take:

Hey everybody, reporting from my grandpa's newly constructed Mole-Hill. I'm glad Sam explained my situation so I don't have to!

Mario Kart Mobile is boring. Sam is correct on this assertion.
The boring-ness isn't even the biggest offender of this game - it's the lack of a score counter. I could tell you I played for 3 hours before losing and you wouldn't be able to tell if I actually played for 1 minute or 3 hours. Here's proof of my 3 hour run:

This game is so boring it doesn't even have a way to track progress. That's all I have. I'm typing this on a phone, so I hope you can cut me some slack. Hoping the other games I picked out are, uhhh….

**Recommend: No** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 3 hours**

**Did It Work On My Phone: The zip file I downloaded did not include an .apk so I ended up playing it in my mobile browser and that worked, so technically yes?**
