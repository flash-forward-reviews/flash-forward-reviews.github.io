## Skeeter's Take:

When my friends and I would play Super Smash Brothers, we would eventually find ourselves turning items all the way up and selecting a custom stage. I am not sure if this custom stage was built by one of my friends, or a popular custom map, but I’m sure everyone who’s played a custom stage in SSB has at least experienced what I call “The Box”. 

The Box was, as the name implies, a giant box with a tiny hole in the top of it. Here’s an example below - the red line will be explained shortly.

Since the goal of Super Smash Bros is to knock your opponent off of the stage, this meant the only way to knock your opponent out was by launching them through the small hole at the top of the box. This generally resulted in the player rapidly ricocheting around the box until they hit the perfect trajectory to rocket free from its clutches. You can see the red line above to help visualize. This eventually devolved until each player had such high damage, there would be multiple bodies bouncing erratically around the box for several minutes until their bodies would come to rest. 

Crazy Block Stacking is what would happen if everyone in the Box had maximum percent damage, there were a hundred players, and there was no hole to escape. Just endless bouncing. 

Crazy Block Stacking also flashes random colors, and is clearly trying to compete with Pickachu shooting missiles out of the sky for “most people induced into a seizure”.

And yet, despite being called “Crazy Block Stacking”, it’s nowhere near as overstimulating as the Minecraft Movie.

## Sam's Take:

I’ve been trying to crash this game by endlessly spawning boxes, but so far it’s holding strong. The framerate has dipped down to what I can only assume are single digit numbers, but it’s sill running like a champ!

After another two minutes of constant clicking I have turned it into a powerpoint. I don’t really know what happens when a flash game crashes. Do we see an error message? Does the whole browser tab get messed up? I hope to see soon!

Thought I broke it for a sec there, but just highlighted it on accident.

We’ve gotten to the point where there are 27 seconds between frames, but the game is still technically running. Alright Crazy Block Stacking. I’m calling it quits here, congrats on your victory. Well played.
