## Skeeter's Take:

Every choice in A Evening News is baffling. From the choice to start with a long walking animation from a random man who looks like Steve Harvey, to the vagueness of the actual news report, and all the way down to the title “A Evening News”, I am even more confuddled by the strange enigma who is Keviny250 (Same dev that made Valentine’s Day).

## Sam's Take:

Why does it list multiple possible disasters and responses? Is it supposed to be satire of how news is just Mad-Libed tragedy? If that’s the case then why is half the video just a man walking down the street and sitting down?

Is it a joke? Am I supposed to get something out of this? I have no idea what the intention of A Evening News is. Even the title is multiple layers of wrong. Obviously it should be “An Evening News”, but even that doesn’t really make sense... “The Evening News”? What the fuck is this? The Flash Forward Game Jam is fucked man.
