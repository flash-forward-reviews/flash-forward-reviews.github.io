## Sam's Take:

I’m in Ohio for the next week, which means Skeeter and I will be in different time zones. This may mean I go to bed before he writes his reviews, and so I might update his reviews when I wake up in the mornin’. Also I’ll be on a laptop and visiting family, so the games may be short and bad. You probably won’t notice a difference there.

ANYWHO, Ball Challenge is a game where you control a ball around an obstacle course and try to reach the end. I reached the end once. I felt very little.

Can you beat my time? Probably, but you don’t need to. There is a bounce pad in this game that makes you go really high though. I like the height of the bounce pad jump.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 11 Minutes** 

## Skeeter's Take:

Sam went to bed before I had written my review! What a pervert!
