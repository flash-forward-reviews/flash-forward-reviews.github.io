## Sam's Take:

For a game with such a shitpost title, it’s kind of lit. You have a truck, it moves fast, and you have to make it move faster. Don’t move fast enough, truck explodes. After each round you can buy upgrades to make truck move even more fasterer. Move the fastererest and you win the game. It’s simple, but sometimes I just want to see shit go fast. This is an excellent high-school-computer-lab game. Remember when we all became hackers using proxies to access addictinggames.com?

I was done with my review, but I realized I forgot to mention that the animations are cute!!

The animations are cute.

Phew, glad to have that off my chest.
 
**Recommend: Yea**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 20% (Itch.io is down as I write this, I’m saying it’s 20% that it is still down when Skeeter writes his review, and we’ll have to go in for a re-review).**

**Time Played: 30 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

Look, if they can get Keanu for Cyberpunk 2077, they have to get him for the sequel to Speed The Movie: The Game. 

That’s the only joke I have. I played 30 seconds of the game because I just got home and now have to go to bed in a few minutes and wake up early to go to my job so I’m typing something to mostly say that I typed something. 

Zero effort? Meet my lack of will. You two will get along great. 

**Recommend: Seems like a real game!**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Seems like we might replay!**

**Time Played: Seems like it was only 30 seconds of playtime!**
