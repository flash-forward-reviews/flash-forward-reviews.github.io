## Skeeter's Take:

Play with me is a simple little game - it’s essentially three different mini-games wrapped up in a Tamagotchi package:

Play With Me gives you three little creatures you have to feed and play with. Each creature has their own mini-game associated with it. We’ve got:

As you play, a different critter that looks like a cat will pop up on screen and say “Play With Me” (Not pictured - I failed my Snipping Tool Pokemon Snap quicktime event. Prof. Oak is going to be so pissed)

After you go back to the main screen, one of your creatures will be dead. This sequence repeats until the game ends.

Play With Me has a fancy skin, but it is just a mini-game package. The games feel appropriate to what you would find on a Tamagotchi, so I think it’s very intentional. Unfortunately, this isn’t really my kind of game - I just didn’t really care to play mini-games that I have played before, and the creepypasta cat doesn’t really do much for me.  I think it would help to have some sort of conclusion to the game, rather than a fade-to-brown and then credits. Maybe have the cat that keeps killing your creatures be the only selection, and you can go in and play all the mini-games that the previous creatures had. This would let the player keep playing, and insinuate that the cat is essentially forcing the player to “Play With” it. The title of the game is Play With Me, the damn cat keeps repeating it every time he kills one of your creatures, and yet there is no way to “Play With Me”.

## Sam's Take:

Like Skeeter said, the gimmick of this game is that the cat wants you to only play with it, so it kills the other pets and takes over their games. Maybe it’s because I don’t have any personal connections to Tamagotchi, but I wasn’t exactly devastated to lose a pet or a minigame. I partially wonder if the game being two screens deep (my computer, then the fake handheld) was too much separation to feel any danger.

It feels like there needs to be something else to get us attached to the other pets, even just a little bit. A longer time managing their hunger maybe? Maybe give each a task that shows off its unique personality? I don’t want to armchair dev and say “you should have added this mechanic”, all I’m trying to point out is that there was no reason to care when the cat took over the game.

Also on my computer the simon game cut out part way through the sequence multiple times, making the later notes blind guesses. So one third of the minigames don’t really work for me, but hey, the dev made three minigames and built a little narrative around it. Fine practice, nothing to be embarrassed about, but not topping our horror game list for this project. 

**Recommend: Nah**
