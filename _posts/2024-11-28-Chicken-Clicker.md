## Sam's Take:

I thought turkey was the traditional Thanksgiving bird. Is that the joke? Am I missing it?

Skeeter, do you get it?

## Skeeter's Take:

I do not get it. 

Either Sam’s assertion is correct and the joke is using chicken instead of the traditional turkey, or someone is very confused. 

I thought perhaps some subcultures in the US might use chicken as a dish instead of turkey, so I did a quick google search and consulted with ChatGPT and it doesn’t appear like that is the case. 

Is it a joke? 

I’m still not sure. 

Happy Thanksgiving!
