## Skeeter's Take:

Wow, Tim’s Bad Day falls right in my wheelhouse of humor. 
From the moment I saw Tim hop his way down the stairs, I was sold.

Where is Tim going? Why his cellar of course!

And who can blame him? So spacious! 

I love Tim. I love the way Tim walks down stairs. I love that Tim is a passionate cellar enthusiast. I especially love it when Tim raises his arms when a spider gets close to him:

The gameplay is completely functional. The light goes out in Tim’s cellar (#justiceForTim) and spiders run at him. It’s your job as Tim’s guardian angel to protect the innocent creature from arachnids trying to harm him. You have a small light you can shine that will scare them away. Protect Tim at all costs. 

It’s a simple mini-game, but it works. It’s not why I’m here. I’m just here for Tim. Timheads unite!
Tim Nation is going strong. Tim is on the up. Tim is streets ahead. Tim is Tim. 

**Recommend: Tim**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Tim**

**Time Played: 7:13 (I tired to spell “Tim” with numbers, but it ended in a Tie)** 

## Sam's Take:

Everything Skeeter has said is correct, but I would also like to add that the music while you play is obviously just sung by the dev into their shitty mic. They change tempo, run out of breath, make mouth sounds between syllables, it’s incredible. Also I survived for 1 minute and 39 seconds and never heard the song loop, which means he sat there going “dun dun duuun. Do do Dudiudi dun dun dun...” for at least 99 seconds. You should absolutely click on this and play it in-browser for a minute, it's funny in the good way.

**Recommend: Yes!**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 3%**

**Time Played: 2min**

SKEETER EDIT: Holy shit, I accidentally played the game with the tab muted. The music is phenomenal. 10/10 game
