## Sam's Take:

This game has sauce dude. Duck is CUTE, music is BOPPIN', the house comes out of the sand, and that’s funny. They released this game with a bug that made it unbeatable the first time, so they gave us a whole new beatable version. They did not fix their misspelling of “acquired”, but I probably wouldn’t have noticed if my wife hadn’t glanced over and said “they spelled ‘acquired’ wrong”.

I’m pretty sick today, so  maybe I’m confused and delirious, but I enjoy this screen where your little duck fins (flippers?) come out to smother your broken walkie-talkie in glue.

## Skeeter's Take:
