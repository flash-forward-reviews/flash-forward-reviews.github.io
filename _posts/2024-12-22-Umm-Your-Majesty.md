## Sam's Take:

Umm, Your Majesty is a game about a dystopian gig-economy nightmare world where we’ve devolved back to a monarchy. You play as a miserable laborer who was fed lies about escaping “wage-slavery”, and now drives for a per-gig limo service. With federal and local governments dissipated, there is no system in place for fixing our roads, and so when you happen to pick up the king on your route, you must dodge potholes as well as political assassination attempts on your way to the castle.

It’s a warning about replacing bad systems with worse ones. Wages and massive corporations with competition-based work, our current government with a monarchical reign. What does it mean when a tree falls on your car and depletes all your health in 0.5 seconds? Maybe it’s saying that we drove ourselves to this life. Maybe it’s to represent that a flimsy limousine is all that stands between us and society in total shambles.

And so we beat on, limos against the traffic, borne back ceaselessly into the potholes.

**Recommend: It’s actually almost okay, but no, you get stuck way too often and the top of the screen where you have to look for obstacles is blurry and made my eyes die.** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 15 Min**

## Skeeter's Take:

This looks, feels, and plays like a Roblox game.
