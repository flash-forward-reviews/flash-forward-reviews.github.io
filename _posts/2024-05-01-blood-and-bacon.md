## Sam's Take:

For the sake of transparency, I must let you know that we don‚Äôt yet understand how these reviews are going to work. The only things we know are that we are timing how long we play each game, and that if we want we can continue playing the same game in a future review.

I‚Äôm sure this will morph into some horrid abomination when we‚Äôre on day 214 and there‚Äôs no hope left in our hearts, but right now that‚Äôs the plan. The only thing I can say for certain about these reviews is that they will contain more Blood and Bacon.

For $1 on Steam ($1.13 if you live in Chicago and need to pay the entertainment tax), you get a multiplayer arena PVE Boomer Shooter that as far as I can tell, basically never ends.

There are multiple weapons, and some resource management elements, but frankly none of that matters. All that matters is you move fast, angry pigs move fast and you both try to make the other dead. I could try and make some finer points about the gameplay loop, but really only needs to do two things well: Move quick, and keep adding new shit. 

So far we are seven levels deep and we‚Äôve shocked pigs with an electric fence, grinded their bodies for bullets, got chased by a fucking overpowered floating pac-man pig head and painted a beautiful scenic photo with a paintball gun. Every level has been a new experience, and I‚Äôm very curious how long they can keep this up.

I can guarantee we will play more of this, it‚Äôs a simple joy, so I leave some deeper explanations for future reviews. For now, if you wanna move fast and shoot stuff with friends, this shit is a dollar. One US dollar. It‚Äôs already worth it, why not?

## Skeeter's Take:

One of you may be familiar with our previous review project (sorry Pound the Puss dev, I‚Äôve grown a lot since those days). We played a flash game everyday for a year and decided if it was better or worse than Club Penguin. To call them ‚Äúreviews‚Äù might be generous, but our goal is similar here - we want to play a game a day and write about it. Seeing as Flash is deader than my childhood dog we buried in our backyard, and since Disney took Club Penguin out back behind the shed like it was bit by a rabid wolf (also what happened to my dog üòû), we can no longer use our old format. This Amoeba Changling of reviews will eventually pick a creature type (I really hope you are an MTG player), and solidify into a hopefully fun format, but I won‚Äôt rehash what Sam‚Äôs already said. 

Anywho - on to BLOOD AND BACON 

For a dollar, this game is way better than it has any right to be. First, you can be a skeleton, which is always a win in my book. I mean, just look at this:

Still not convinced? You can also be a slew of other characters (all living) if you feel so inclined. Not that I would understand why you would do that. 

The gameplay loop itself is pretty simple - it‚Äôs essentially an arena wave shooter in the vein of COD Zombies or the like. Except instead of zombies you are fighting variations of boars - some of which also happen to be zombies. You unlock weapons the further you get into the rounds and there are various secrets, and small challenges sprinkled throughout that really elevate the game. For example, you can ‚Äújuggle‚Äù a piece of boar carnage in the air, and if you hit a count of 20, fireworks explode in the sky (not pictured). 
We only made it to round 7, but there was enough enemy variation to keep things interesting - yes they are all boars, but some of those boars are skeletons, or polkadot and have more health.

There is also a tunnel system labyrinth that seems to be procedurally generated where you can unlock ‚Äúrelics‚Äù. We found an ‚ÄúIrish Frock‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt tell you what it did - we met our final demise in the tunnels to a floating head Pac-Man boar that ambushed both Sam and I while we were shooting codes into doors. Listen, if that last sentence wasn‚Äôt enough to get you interested, I don‚Äôt know what will. 

Overall, I had a great ‚Äútime‚Äù with this game.

Better than Club Penguin

Sorry, old habits die hard.
