## Sam's Take:

It plays the American Dad intro, except it pauses every few seconds and requires you to press a button to continue.

I’m visiting my friend for the long 4th of July weekend, so I apologize in advance for hittin’ up the low hanging fruit this week. Skeeter used to watch the show though, so maybe he’ll have something to say?

Happy Freedom everyone!

## Skeeter's Take:

The dev encourages people to speedrun this game:

The best part about American Dad (PC EMULATOR) is that there are actually people posting their speedrunning times and  glitch tricks in the comments:

And boy does it have some glitches, I couldn’t even get the damn thing to run correctly. First time, I got stuck on the first screen, and the second time it played through without sound. I am not playing a third time. 

I did use to watch American Dad. It is 100% a guilty pleasure that I don’t like to own up to, but I will defend “Daddy’s Gone” til the grave (what an absolute banger):
