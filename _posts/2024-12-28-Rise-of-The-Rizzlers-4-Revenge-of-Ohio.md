## Skeeter's Take:

Rise of the Rizzlers 4: Revenge of Ohio was only selected because Sam is currently in Ohio. 

This is one of the more strange platformers we have played. First of all, it would appear that the player controls Drake for some reason:

When Drake jumps he makes a nice little “Hank Hill”-esque grunt that I find very funny. 

The platforming isn’t difficult and there are no enemies. You just sort of jump through the level until the ending. There are a few hazards to avoid, but nothing difficult. There is a timer, which I believe is intended for a time trial, but it doesn’t display your final time at the end. You have to use a hotkey to check your time, which I forgot to do, but I’m sure my time was stellar. 

Then, in one of the more baffling creative choices I’ve seen, the game ends with Drake walking endlessly through a field while “Send Me on My Way” by Rusted Root plays.

There’s no real ending. This just loops endlessly. I can’t really explain why - perhaps it has something to do with my unrequited love for “Send Me on My Way” - but I absolutely loved this. Had me smiling while I watched Drake high-step over pumpkins. 

Also, for a game called “Rise of the Rizzlers 4: Revenge of Ohio”, the game doesn’t rely on shitty memes for the game, and I just wanted to commend it for that.

**Recommend: NO-Hio**

## Sam's Take:

Everything Skeeter said is correct, and I would like to add that I checked the developer’s other games, and there are no other Rise of the Rizzlers games. Between Skeeter and I, there are just too many questions that need answering. Luckily this game was released less than a week ago, so I figured there was a chance the dev would answer:

We’ll let you know if they respond.

**Recommend: No**

**Time Played: 2 Minutes**
