## Skeeter's Take:

Aggressive music blares. Apples are falling from the top of the screen. A body-less and leg-less blue girl smiles vacantly at me with coal-black eyes. The words “EAT” and “APPLE” alternate flashing in and out of existence. They feel subliminal, like someone is trying to Clockwork Orange brain program me.

I awkwardly maneuver each of the floating hands near the sickly girl's mouth. An apple perches on top of the prayer position I placed them in.

I carefully lifted the hands upward toward the sky in tribute to the Apple God (Steve Jobs). 
The decapitated child munched on the apple.

A new upbeat and cheery tune now played. Apples rained from the sky. The girl (despite lack of a body) looked not only content, but happy. 

And then she ate another apple, and the bright victory music restarted. So I kept feeding the girl apples, and the song would keep on resetting. 

And that was kind of funny I guess. 

I would like to point out, this ending feels heavily influenced by the ending of the hit GameMaker Studio game “The Nerdy Bartender”
