## Skeeter's Take:

Man, do I really have to explain fucking Clown? 
In this glorified powerpoint you have to search for the exact invisible pixel hidden somewhere on the current image to click on to advance to the next image. Eventually a clown shows up. Then a balloon. Then the balloon pops. The End.

At least the comments seem to like it:

## Sam's Take:

Bro, this guy has over 30 games on itch.io. 

[Aladdin203](https://aladdin203.itch.io/){:target="_blank"}, I hope you're okay with being used as a punchline every time I have a Magic The Gathering draft and don’t have time for a real review.

Skeeter, I just clicked on a bunch of their games and we should have reviewed Space! Space is amazing.

Next time.

Next time we’ll review Space.

**Recommend: No?**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0.02%**

**Time Played: 18 Seconds**
