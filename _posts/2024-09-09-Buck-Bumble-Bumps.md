## Skeeter's Take:

Sam sent me the title track to some N64 game I’ve never heard of called “Buck Bumble” today. The song went extremely hard. 

Sam also jokingly sent me the phrase “Can’t wait to review BUCK BUMBLE” so, naturally I took it upon myself to type “Buck Bumble” into itch.io’s search engine and to my absolute shock there was a single relevant hit: Buck Bumble Bumps!

Much to my chagrin, Buck Bumble Bumps automatically triggered the firing of my “DO NOT RECOMMEND” gun by being yet another Flappy Bird ripoff. 

I do not like Flappy Bird clones, I didn’t like the original Flappy Bird game, I didn’t understand the Flappy Bird craze, and furthermore, I thought it was not very fun even by mobile game standards. I would have never guessed how many Flappy Bird clones I would go through in this project that we haven’t and will never review. We don’t always pick the first game we find and often there’s a little digging involved. If I’m exploring and blind clicking on games on itch.io, I would say nearly 40% of the games are Flappy Bird clones. Normally, if I’m not going into something completely blind and it’s a shitty Flappy Bird ripoff, I just throw it to the side. How much can really be said about Flappy Bird? How much is there really to critique? Flappy Bird is so uninteresting, when the games ripping it off are good, they still suck because they are just Flappy Bird. When the games that are ripping it off are bad, they either don’t function, or are bad because they are just Flappy Bird. Flappy Bird is so banal to me that I would rather just vaguely reference how much I dislike Flappy Bird rather than giving you explanations or reasons for my distaste for Flappy Bird. Quite frankly, I feel that reading a breakdown of why Flappy Bird sucks would be worse than what I’ve already written here - Flappy Bird is that shade of beige.

Thanks for your time and consideration reading my thesis: “Flappy Bird Sucks: A Divisive Opinion in Modern America”.

Now, on to my next section: 

Buck Bumble Bumps Ballistic Bullet(point)s: 
~~The itch.io page has a download button that leads to a download of an .html - I mention this because itch.io has a built-in web player and that feature seems to have been ignored.\
~~Doesn’t use the banging theme song from the game it is based on\
~~Is Flappy Bird\
~~Has these weird green orbs on the letterbox bars - this doesn’t really affect gameplay or anything but is a very strange design choice that I thought was worth mentioning:
