## Skeeter's Take:

After yesterday’s game, “[Fuck Magicians](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-352){:target="_blank"}”, I fully know what to expect with “Fuck Aliens”. Listen, I’m a fan of the Mass Effect series, so I’m certainly not above it. Now let’s see what sexy alien xenomorph babes await us in “Fuck Aliens”:

**Recommend: It’s serviceable, the gameplay is decent, the aliens are sexy, but damn is it super frustrating trying to enter any door horizontally.**

**Replay Percentage Chance: I don’t think we are going to get to any of the games we gave “100%”, and we certainly aren’t revisiting this one**

**Time Played: Oh I don’t know, jeeze.**

## Sam's Take:

Only alien I would fuck:

**Recommend: I’m sorry that every review is just an inside joke now**

**Replay Percentage Chance: I feel like we’ve earned this though**

**Time Played: Honestly game is pretty good**
