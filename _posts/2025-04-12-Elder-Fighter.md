## Sam's Take:

I hate this game because it disappears every time I take a screenshot. I’ve even tried using the timer function in Snipping Tool and it just won’t work. I’m on my laptop, so maybe that has something to do with it, but I prefer to blame the game. I took a picture of the fucking thumbnail to get the above shot.

It’s a one on one fighter where two MS Paint grandmas punch each other. It’s bad and has a two player mode. 

Pretend this text is a screenshot.

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Fuck**

**Time Played: Fart**

## Skeeter's Take:

I hate this game because I spent 5 minutes pressing every button on my keyboard just to figure out how to start it. 

I hate this game because of the weird tumors protruding from each of the old men.

I hate this game because my opponent just held out his fist and ran into me over and over again until I died. 

I hate this game because I couldn’t even get a screenshot of the man running at me with his fist extended and that was the only kind of funny part of this game. 

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Lmao I can’t believe we still have this with 18 days left**

**Time Played: 3 minutes**
