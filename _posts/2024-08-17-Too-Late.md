## Sam's Take:

The man is army. The man fall down from plane. Maybe man pick up lightning, maybe bomb. Does not matter, they don’t do. Mad hits floor, turns sideways. Man slides. Game ends.

No score. No goal. No reason.

This game is completely unreviewable, and I have to respect that.

**Recommend: Nope**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 2 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

Skeeter sent in his review TOO LATE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA (Sam note: I played D&D until 11:30pm and Skeeter is on vacation so this is actually 100% my fault, but I did choose a game called “Too Late” just to make this joke. Will Skeeter delete this when he feverishly remembers to send in his review? Will he just type “lol” beneath this note? Only time will tell?)

**Recommend: Too**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Late**

**Time Played: Skeeter**
