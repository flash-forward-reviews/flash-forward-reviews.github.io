## Sam's Take:

Dungeon exploration game where you walk around and collect 5 flowers until you see this screen:

There’s some hidden walls and I accidentally got out of bounds once. It’s a cute project, but you don’t need to play it.

THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS SKEETER FORGOT TO DO HIS REVIEW

HAHA HAHA SKEETER IS A STINKY GUY!

## Skeeter's Take:

My butt is full of poop. I’m Skeeter FARRRRRRT

So, I fell asleep last night and forgot to review a game. How appropriate is “Forget Me Nots” for today's (yesterday’s) review? I’m sure Sam picked the game based on the title, but it also centers around a dream, and I was totally sleeping during this. 

Forget Me Nots is exactly as Sam said. Nothing really stands out as interesting or elevating in this game. It’s mostly in black and white and has some pixel graphics - there’s not really much to look at, there doesn’t seem to be a deeper meaning to the forget me nots or dream setting. Everything is functional, but I was pretty bored while playing. 

**Recommend: Down**
