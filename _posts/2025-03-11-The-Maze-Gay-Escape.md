## Skeeter's Take:

**Recommend: Swagger**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Opponent Pokemon’s attack raised sharply! It became confused!**

**Time Played: “The exaggerated swagger…”**

## Sam's Take:

My first question about this game was “where’s the gay?”, but luckily Skeeter’s video answered that for me. Thanks Skeeter!

My next question is, why is the dev’s itch.io username their social security number, and why are their only games both The Maze Gay Escape, except one doesn’t load?
