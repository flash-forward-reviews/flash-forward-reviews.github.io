## Skeeter's Take:

Happy St. Patrick’s Day, everyone! In celebration of the day before the streets become lined with puke, I’ve picked out a festive theme game by the name of “St. Patrick’s Day Fiesta”.

In St. Patrick’s Day Fiesta, Mario coins and kitchen knives will rotate and move across a green background. It is a green background, because it’s a St. Patrick’s Day game and St. Patrick’s day is green. There are gold Mario coins because gold is associated with the leprechaun mascot of the holiday, and nothing says “St. Patrick’s day” like a Japanese-created Italian plumber.

Sidenote: I just had the revelation that Leprechaun Mario is basically just Luigi:

Lastly, the knives are there because the Irish have historically been stereotyped as violent… 

Or the dev just threw some knives in there, I’m not really sure. 

Click the coins and get points. Click the knives and lose points. Keep clicking until the timer runs out and post your score on the leaderboard.

Oh, I’m sorry. Did I forget to mention there’s a fucking LEADERBOARD:

I am circled in red. I put my name as “StPatrickHimself” for the first run. The second run I tried typing “IAmStPatrick”, but accidentally entered it as “IAm”. Lastly, I figured the most effective technique out and topped the leaderboard with “IAmStPatrick”. I wanted to pick a name that really oozed St. Patrick’s Day theme as this game barely qualifies as a St. Patrick’s Day game. I don’t know, I thought it was kind of funny. 

The aqua colored circles are who I believe are the developer based on the name:

I do not point this out not only to brag (yeah, I’m pretty much a gamer), but to point out one major flaw with the game. 

The most effective method I found was to constantly mash the left click button and just move the mouse pointer towards the most populated points of the screen. It doesn’t matter if you click on a knife as they don’t deduct enough points to really make that much of a difference. I got the high score from widely waving my mouse around with my auto-click macro on. The game pretends to be a game about precise and quick clicking where the intention is to have the player avoid the knives, but in reality it’s actually a “how fast can you click” game. My other two lower scores were me trying to legitimately play the game, and the top score was my auto-click “click-on-anything” run. 

I know I’m being nit-picky, but I’d like to remind you that the dev previously held the top score on the leaderboard, so they had to have been aware of this oversight, correct? Did they click randomly across the screen, get the high score and think “Yup, that’s exactly how my game is supposed to be played.” Did they have a moment where they stopped and thought, “Should I double the points subtracted when I click on a knife so that it discourages me from doing so?” Or is this all intentional? Was I supposed to turn my macro on and make figure 8’s with my mouse until I won? 

Are they just a god tier gamer who legitimately got that score and perhaps I am the problem?

There are some things better left to be pondered sober - see you in a year. 

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 5% for LEADERBOARD**

**Time Played: 6 mins**

P.S.
I was feeling insecure about not having proof of my high score, or any way to prove that I am actually IAmStPatrick and StPatrickHimsel and, yes, even Iam. This story is going to sound so made up, but I did have the picture of the high score ending screen for proof, but I left it in the snipping tool to copy and paste into the review when I started it, and then I took another screenshot and overwrote that one, effectively losing it forever. I think the CIA might have hacked me. 

I did manage to still have the screenshot I saved earlier of my 520 score, so you can see that I did in fact earn that score, and I’m also the only person to mention the St. Patrick. I swear I’m not a phony! I’m not a fraud! I really did use an auto-clicker to cheat a high score!

I cannot prove I am “iam” - might have been a dog food CEO on that one.
