## Sam's Take:

It’s just a demo showing off a script that makes 3D rope physics work in the Godot engine. I don’t understand how it works, or how one would implement it, but there are instructions in the description that I’m assuming make sense to the Godot-using folk.

The only reason this is here is because it’s made by the creator of [Blaster](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-94){:target="_blank"} [Meltdown](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-221){:target="_blank"}, Palin_Drome. Remember that time I got a sub 100 Seconds in Blaster Meltdown?

I do.

**Recommend: If you want to use 3D rope physics in Godot I guess**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 2 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

I’m honestly at a loss for what more to say. The ropes move sort of like how I would imagine a rope in a game would move, so good job. Where are the ropes in Blaster Meltdown? That’s my question and segway into reminding everyone of my sub 100 second Blaster Meltdown run:

**Recommend: Nevermind**

**Replay Percentage Chance: In Utero**

**Time Played: Bleach**
