## Sam's Take:

I only picked this game because I had been messing with raytracing settings in The Witcher 3 to test out my new gpu, but I got more than I bargained for. It’s Quake-like shooter with a grappling hook and two levels that it swaps between seemingly at random. On time I was shooting zombies and hooked on to a platform only for the level to switch and I was suddenly inside the spawning area of a million floating faces and game overed instantly.

I have no idea what the idea was here, but I have never played anything like this before. The gimmick doesn’t really work, it mostly just makes things confusing, but what is a free solo-dev game for if not just trying out some weird new idea?

Oh also the game didn’t work in Chrome for me? So rise up FireFox squad I guess.

**Recommend: Not to play, but for sure to see wtf is going on**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Probably not**

**Time Played: 5 Minutes**
