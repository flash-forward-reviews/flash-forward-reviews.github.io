## Sam's Take:

I only picked this game because I had been messing with raytracing settings in The Witcher 3 to test out my new gpu, but I got more than I bargained for. It’s Quake-like shooter with a grappling hook and two levels that it swaps between seemingly at random. On time I was shooting zombies and hooked on to a platform only for the level to switch and I was suddenly inside the spawning area of a million floating faces and game overed instantly.

I have no idea what the idea was here, but I have never played anything like this before. The gimmick doesn’t really work, it mostly just makes things confusing, but what is a free solo-dev game for if not just trying out some weird new idea?

Oh also the game didn’t work in Chrome for me? So rise up FireFox squad I guess.

**Recommend: Not to play, but for sure to see wtf is going on**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Probably not**

**Time Played: 5 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

I too was thrust through cycling levels much like Sam. I couldn’t figure out what exactly made the level switch, but I noticed that there was a wheel indicator that filled up much like a timer:

I had started working up a theory that maybe the levels were time based. Unfortunately, the next level I was loaded into was nothing but an empty single square platform:

I watched my theory go up in smoke as the timer reset numerous times. I was still stuck in the abyss. Not sure how to proceed, I threw myself off the side of the platform and am not stuck eternally in the milky-blue void:

Still no idea how this game works. 

**Recommend: Naw**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Raw**

**Time Played: Paw**
