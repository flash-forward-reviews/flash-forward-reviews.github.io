## Skeeter's Take:

Welcome to Taxi Driver - Cyberpunk 2077! We’ve got: 

*1.* Terrible car controls that feel more like drunk driving a Zamboni than a car. 

*2.* Curbs and obstacles! If your taxi happens to run into any of these it will become stuck and be unable to move!

*3.* Phun Physics: If you get lucky, instead of getting stuck the physics engine will sneak into the bathroom to hit a bump and toss your taxi spiraling into the air

*4.* T-Posing NPCs!

So, yeah, Taxi Driver - Cyberpunk 2077 is actually very accurate to release patch Cyberpunk 2077, and delivers a very similar experience. Kudos! 

The dev(s) clearly ha(ve)s a sense of humor about their game. Here’s a section from the description on their about page that made me laugh:

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 10%**

**Time Played: 8 minutes**

(I actually liked release day Cyberpunk 2077 despite its many bugs and flaws. Don’t @ Skeeter On The Mic me)

THEY FUCKING NAILED IT!

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: No**

**Time Played: Yes**

(I had very mixed feelings about release day Cyberpunk 2077 and still do, but I keep playing it because I have a disease. Don’t @ Skeeter On The Mic me)
