Hey Alexa, play Space Jam by Jay-Z.

Everybody get up, it’s time to slam.

## Skeeter's Take:

What more can I even say about Space? I still adore it. It’s still extremely funny to me. 

Space still holds a special place in my heart. The discovery and overall experience I had with Space is unparalleled by anything else we’ve played for this project. Space is my champion. Space is my muse. I love Space for everything it is. 

I wanted to remix the old video I made for Space (I got better at the greenscreen… I think?), but the files are completely lost on my computer. Instead, I created this terrible tribute from scratch.

I think it’s just proof that the experience of some things truly cannot be captured twice. Most attempts to remake lightning in a bottle fall short. 

And nobody could make another Space. Nobody could capture what Space is ever again, and I think they would be mad for trying. That makes Space really special to me. 

337 days, and I never forgot you, Space. 

And I probably never will. 

**Recommend: Yes**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 100%**

**Time Played: I’ve lost count at this point**
