## Skeeter's Take:

Get The Cheesy Puffs! Is a (very) short narrative game. The player follows Scratch the Cat- 
Wait, no.

**Recommend: The next narrative trigger happens after consuming 50 cheetos, and I can only deduce the dev of Get The Cheesy Puffs! is a fan of 50 (both the game and the number). Are we witnessing the birth of the Scratch the Cat/50 game-imatic universe???**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 50**

**Time Played: 50** 

## Sam's Take:
