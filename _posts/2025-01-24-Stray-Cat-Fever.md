## Skeeter's Take:

Right click to move your karate cat. Left click to attack other karate cats. Make it as far as you can. 

Except the other cats don’t attack you and opt for the bold strategy of “stand there” for both their defensive and offensive plans. You can walk by every cat. There is virtually no way to lose. The game is actually a battle of attrition. And it also is committing the cardinal sin of being a walking simulator while pretending to be a fighting game.

It’s so late, it took me way too long to realize what a “Fart Hest” was and why I kept getting further from it…

**Recommend: Naw, cat**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0 chances**

**Time Played: Fart Hest: 3m**

## Sam's Take:

Is this game about cops? Because all you do is kill unarmed civilians who aren’t fighting back.

**Recommend: I found what I thought was an actual stray cat today**

**Replay Percentage Chance: It followed me around for 20 minutes**

**Time Played: Turns out it’s a known cat in the neighborhood and does this to everyone. It has a home. We’re good.**
