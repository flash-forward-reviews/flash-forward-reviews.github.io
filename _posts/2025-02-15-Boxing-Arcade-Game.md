## Sam's Take:

I went to an arcade and played a game that judged your strength based on how hard you punched a bag. I don’t know what the numbers mean and it cost a fucking dollar for two punches. Low value. I sent Skeeter a video of it, I’m sure he’ll have an excellent opinion.
 
**Recommend: I wouldn’t buy that for a dollar!**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 5%**

**Time Played: 18 Seconds**

## Skeeter's Take:

Sam gave me instructions that he was going to send me a video and I was going to have to review the video for today's review. I am pretty sure he meant review the boxing game from the video instead of review his performance on the game, but I opted to do neither of those options:
