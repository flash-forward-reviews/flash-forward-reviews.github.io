## Skeeter's Take:

ShipsGame is a fine proof of concept mini-game where you shine a light to guide ships from hitting each other or the shore. The lighthouse light more resembles that of a spotlight and the ships are drawn to them like moths to flame. 

The only issue is there aren’t any specific routes or directions the ships need to follow, so the only requirement is ultimately “Don’t let the ships hit each other.” This makes it incredibly easy to turn any ship around immediately and guide it off the closest edge of the screen, never to see it again. The only risk with this method is on the unlucky occasion a new ship should spawn at the same time you are directing your ship off the screen.

## Sam's Take:

That’s not what lighthouses are for.

Also why is it daytime?
