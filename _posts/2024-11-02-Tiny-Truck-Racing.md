## Sam's Take:

Drive in a circle. Sometimes a battery appears on the road that makes you go faster for a second. For some reason one race is twelve laps. It’s all functional, but the minimal racer interaction and long races make this a pretty sleepy game. I did win once though!

It’s totally fine, but this is the definition of nothing special. I’m excited to see how Skeeter can even make a review out of this.
