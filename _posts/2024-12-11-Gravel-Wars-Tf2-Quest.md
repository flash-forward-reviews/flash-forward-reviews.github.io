## Skeeter's Take:

It took me longer than I’d like to admit to figure out how to leave spawn (go gate). I managed to kill the Engineer by pulling out my shotgun (fight engineer) and shooting him in the face (use x3). I grabbed the intel (take intel) and gave it to the spy back at spawn (give intel). Not sure what to do next, I went back over to the Blue base (go blubase) and was told I could see the intel, but when I typed to take the intel (take intel), it would tell me there is no intel in the room.

I don’t know what to do from here. What I can say is if I wanted to play TF2, a text based game would be my last option. I know this is just a dev build, but the text gameplay felt extremely limited. It felt more like I was trying to figure out the secret password that would allow me to progress forward. I did not try the other classes besides scout, so perhaps there are some differences. I just wasn’t really interested in playing any more of Gravel Wars: TF2 Quest.

**Time Played: 15 minutes**

## Sam's Take:

This really makes me appreciate good text adventures more than I had before. It’s so easy to know what you want to do, but not be able to do it. Personally, I checked the restock cabinet, then could not for the life of me find a way to leave the restock cabinet. This game is in desperate need of a “check your surroundings” command, that gives you some possible commands, or at least a few available directions.

Did you know I made a text based adventure for school?

Did you know that it will never see the light of day?

**Recommend: No, but at least the dev is braver than I am for posting it** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: no**

**Time Played: some**
