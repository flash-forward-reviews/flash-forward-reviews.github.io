## Skeeter's Take:

I’m going to try something new today and “live react” to this game as I play through it. I’ll post my thoughts here as I have them, and we’ll see if this was a really terrible idea by the end!

DEAD DETENTION #1 (RESCRIBBLED): 

00:00 - I have a secret. 

00:30 - That took forever to load. What are the odds this game has a title screen? I hope I don’t just have to use this:

01:35 - Game just asked if I was playing on a touchscreen. I resisted the temptation to use my mouse to click “yes”.

03:00 - SAVED!

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet1.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

03:30 - HOLY FUCK THIS IS LOUD, BUT PROPS ON THIS MENU. VERY CLEAN. SORRY I’M SHOUT TEXTING SO I CAN HEAR MYSELF OVER THE MUSIC. 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet3.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

5:00 - The settings have a music volume adjustment so we are riding high now. Playing on Easy because I’m not a man with something to prove. 

06:30 - I failed the first mini-game because I didn’t realize I was playing Warioware. Turns out when the game said “Sleep!” it meant to tell me “Click on the sheep or lose!”.

09:00 - Not much happening. I’m playing some anime high school kid with electric-blue hair who fell asleep in class. My teacher reprimanded me for falling asleep. Not much to report, I’m really only filling you in so I can show you this face:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet5.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

I like the line paper outlines. Adds some character. 

10:00 - Just played another mini-game (nailed it). I think this is Warioware with a story? Idk. 

14:00 - The teacher asked me about Lord of the Flies and my character gave the dumbest answer. Then this goody two-shoes butts in like a friggen nerd and makes me look like an idiot. Screw you, nerd!

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet6.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

It’s ok. I shrugged it off. The teacher was not happy. 

16:12 - Attack on Titan mentioned

17:14 - I’ve got a nearly empty can of Axe Body Spray (probably used one time) and two matches and one solid chance at a makeshift flamethrower.

19:00 - they are on popsicle sticks! 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet7.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

20:00 - the main character’s name is canonically “Max” but I think I might just call him Anime Complainy Boy (ABC). 

21:00 - I’m worried ABC might actually kill himself if he misses the Attack on Titan premiere… I hope Mrs. Whatserface has him under 24 Hour surveillance. 

24:00 - SOMETHING’S HAPPENING

24:50 - AHHH

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet8.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

25:30 - I Warioware’d the evil zombie off of me and survived! 

Wow, some girl with pink hair and more protagonist energy than our real main character just hit the zombie in half with a bat: 

Here’s the zombie:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet9.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

This is her:

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet10.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

29:15 - Just kidding. This is her: 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet11.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

And her sister is trapped in the library. 

31:22 - I’m really liking the “Paper Puppet” style. There was an onomatopoeia in a text bubble and even that was on a stick.

33:00: 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet12.png" caption="Neat" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

34:00 - ABC keeps complaining about his ankle. Outloud. During a Zombie outbreak. 

36:02 - CALLED IT!

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet13.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

36:51 - I think Max may have forgotten that little sister that was supposed to be hiding in the library. I’m sure it’s fine. He saw this in DayZ, as he proudly declared. 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet14.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

38:22 - Against all odds, her sister somehow survived. I have to admit, when I saw who it was, I wished she hadn’t. 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet15.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

40:13 - The alarm for the Attack on Titan premier came back! Now THAT’S how you tie up loose ends! The timer goes off, and the zombies come swarming. I had to play Dead Detention’s version of the Chrome Offline game as the final boss, so that was cool. 

Pausing to play a Deadlock (Experimental Hero mode is only available for a few hours. I’ll be back. Timer Paused.) I think we are rounding the end though!

41:00 - Ok we are back. Naomi is currently trying to sacrifice herself like the idiot and main protagonist she is.

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet16.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

So, naturally I ran away and left her. 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet17.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

43:26 - The Final Review/Game runtime. 
After I tried to run away and leave Naomi to her self-prophesized fate, I am stopped by none other than my Pokemon Rival: 

{% include figure.html image="https://github.com/flash-forward-reviews/img2/blob/main/img/dedet18.png" caption="" alt="" %}{:target="_blank"}

She grabs the bat, smashes the zombies and saves Naomi who honestly seemed disappointed that she didn’t get devoured by zombies. 
That’s it. The end. Bye bye. 

Post-game:

That is exactly what it feels like. A polished and functioning game with a high school-written script. There is something so oddly specific and funny about the writing. The main character is clearly a self-insert (as anyone in high school would do), complete with all their specific hobbies and interests. I also love that the main character is in more despair over the potential to miss the Attack on Titan premier than he did coming face to face with a zombie. 

High School, amirite? 

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Episode 2?**

**Time Played: 43:26 (Game and Review)** 

Edit: Now that Sam has finished his review I can tell you my secret. This is the same developer as Alula Falling, which won’t mean anything to you, but will mean everything to Sam.

## Sam's Take:

Honestly, I’m playing Deus Ex while watching Skeeter type his review live. This is way better than playing Dead Detention (probably).

...

Ugh, fine I’ll play the fucking game.

Aight I finished. It’s cute. Skeeter is right on with all the self-insert main character stuff (what was it with every Newgrounds protagonist and being a student with potential that just never tries?), but the game is totally functional. All the minigames are easy to figure out and were kind of exciting in that sugar-rush Warioware way. It was certainly better than [Pig Goat Banana Cricket: Game Lad Blitz](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-24){:target="_blank"}.

I even like the art style. The lined paper around the characters and the use of fake popsicle sticks softens the blow of obvious high school writing by creating a framing device of a literal high schooler making up the story as we play it. I don’t think the game is self-aware, but it creates a layer of obfuscation that makes it more tolerable than most Newgrounds trash.

If I were a parent, I’d hang this game on my fridge. Now would I pay $4 for [the full Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2967380/Dead_Detention_Rescribbled/){:target="_blank"}?

Would you pay for the drawing on some parent’s fridge?

**Recommend: No, but good job** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: If Part 2 Is Free%**

**Time Played: 20 Minutes**

SAM NOTE: I JUST READ SKEETER’S EDIT!!! HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT GUYSGUYSGUYSGUYSGUYS

THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!
