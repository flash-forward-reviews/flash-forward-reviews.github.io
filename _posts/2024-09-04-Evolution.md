## Skeeter's Take:

Evolution gives you the tools of God and the creatures you create the brain of a machine.

The player is given 3 God tools: Joints (red dots), Bones (black rods), and muscles (red rubber bands). They can then cobble together a monstrosity, and have an AI machine learning brain try to figure out how to make your abomination move. There are a few different movements you can set the AI to train on such as; jumping, running, obstacle jump, climbing, and flying. I couldn’t figure out how to add wings, but I figure that’s just because I was playing on the free web-only demo version instead of the premium $2 version.

The AI will then put your creation through a trial and error process as it tries to figure out how to make your random assortment of muscles and bones move:

That’s pretty much all there is to Evolution, but I had a good time watching my sticks and muscles learn and grow - my most successful monster was probably Gretchen:

While she had a bit of a rough start, eventually she learned to make her way in the world:

**Recommend: Yea**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 9**

**Time Played: Played: 13 minutes**

## Sam's Take:

This is honestly pretty sick. Skeeter showed off running, so I tried to make a jumping creature, but it was a massive failure:

So I went back to the drawing board and thought, “what if I just make a spring?”

Look at that guy go!

This is kind of like an idle game, but with some more creativity. I currently have multiple tabs with different designs going through trials, and I’m having a blast checking in on their progress. Great simple use of neural networks for an enjoyable simulation.  

Open this up on a tab when you’re at work or something. Check on it during your lunch break. Watch your idiot creations grow up. 

HOLY SHIT WHILE WRITING THIS MY BEAR GOT ALL FOUR FEET OFF THE GROUND!!

I’m so hyped about evolution.

**Recommend: Hell yea**

**Replay Percentage Chance: If I think of something funny to make%**

**Time Played: 20 Minutes**
