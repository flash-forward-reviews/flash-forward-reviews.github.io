## Skeeter's Take:

2Pics1Word - a title reminiscent of a decade old internet video that scarred most of us for life, but also a title true to its word. 

The player is shown 2 photos, and given a grid of letters to choose from. The player’s goal is to decipher what word the two photos make when put together. This isn’t challenging in any way; this isn’t a puzzle. I’m almost convinced this is just one of those captchas created to train AI on. 
What’s worse is it’s sometimes hard to understand what the person was thinking when choosing images/words. Don’t get me wrong, it’s always easy to guess the word and these little oddities don’t add any challenge to the game, but I just want to know how the person(s) who made this brian works. 

Take below, for example - the word is “Candycane”, right? Simple enough. But why use a literal candycane for the photo of “candycane”? Why not use a… oh, I don’t know, a picture of a cane?

Another example - I have never once, in my long tiring time on this earth, ever heard someone call email “webmail”. “Hey dude, I’ve been swamped with webmails at work, sorry for not responding.” “Yeah, I sent them a webmail for a quote, just waiting to get a webmail back from them and I’ll let you know your cost.” “I have to check my AOL webmail using my dialup webernet, please don’t make any calls out unless it’s on the webphone.” 
It’s actually starting to grow on me. I might need to work “webmail” into my vocabulary.

## Sam's Take:

Dude what the hell, this game doesn’t have ads or microtransactions, but it’s fully ad/microtransaction ready. We got daily rewards:

Coins as in game currency:

And you can watch more ads to get coins:

Except you can’t, that button doesn’t do anything. It’s like they put it there in case they got contacted by advertisers. This is the worst case scenario. Putting this here proves you’re sellout mobile trash and deserve to have your bones melted until they are bendy enough to tie into a funny necklace, but you don’t even profit off of it. 

Did they think this was going to make it big? You trying to be the next Candy Crush? You’re greedy and stupid. This game sucks and I hate you for making it. I want to thank Skeeter for once again reminding me that I can indeed still taste sweet disgust.

**Recommend: 0%**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 2 Minutes**

**Time Played: No**
