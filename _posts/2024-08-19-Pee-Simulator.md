With this knowledge, I would like to suggest a name change that will more accurately describe the simulation experience: 

“Disembodied-Penis Sideways-Cum Simulator: Shoot it at Smiling Man’s Face!” 

You’re welcome. Free to use. No charge. 

**Recommend: No**

**Replay Percentage Chance: No**

**Time Played: one minute**

## Sam's Take:

Why is a game about swinging a hammer around called Pee Simulator?
