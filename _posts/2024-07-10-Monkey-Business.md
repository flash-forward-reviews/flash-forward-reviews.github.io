## Sam's Take:

Monkey Business is one of many bad platformers we’ve played over both of our review gauntlets. These types of games tend to bleed together, but sometimes a little nugget stands out. This game has two such nuggets, a two note music loop that plays throughout the whole game, and the jump sound effect.

While neither of these things are interesting enough to recommend the game on its own, I does provide me with two more things to add to the Flash-Forward-Doom-Mod-Monster(tm):

**Recommend: Nope**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 1%**

**Time Played: 2 Minutes**

## Skeeter's Take:

By far the best part about this game is the two note loop, with the single soft high-hat hit repeated on loop. I honestly feel like this song would feel right at home amongst the grinding metal and dolphin sounds played during the Waco siege. I think it maybe it should be considered as a form of torture - you can decide if it violates the Geneva convention or not. 
And then yeah, the little “whoo” your guy shouts every time you jump is just the cherry on top. 

Here I made another stupid meme video since Sam already talked about all this and I wouldn’t want it to look like I’m not pulling my weight here:

See you tomorrow!

**Recommend: Not me** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 7 minutes in business**
