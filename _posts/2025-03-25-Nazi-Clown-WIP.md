## Skeeter's Take:

Full disclosure, we reviewed Nazi Clowns (WIP) for our previous project, Flash in the Pan. However, after observing Sam’s review from yesterday, I thought he needed a little lift. 

And Nazi Clowns (WIP) thankfully stands up. 

I don’t know who moved this over to Ruffle, but I stand tall and salute you, brave soul. 

Actually, as I was writing this, I went looking for a screenshot example of a game that requires the newgrounds launcher due to it not being on Ruffle, but it looks like every game has been moved to Ruffle, from what I can tell. I even set the date back to 2005, and clicked on nearly an entire page, and every game launched with Ruffle. That’s dope. It preserves history in all its ugly glory. It’s like walking through the museum and seeing awful atrocities and propaganda but feeling a comfort that it's all been preserved that way we cannot forget said atrocities. It’s a constant reminder of where we come from and what we shouldn’t repeat. 

People were reviewing this game up until 2023:

Nazi Clowns (WIP) has been 23 years in development, and I hope it never gets finished. I’m obviously nostalgic towards it, but that’s mostly because I believe Sam and I found Nazi Clowns pretty early on in the project and it broke our brains. It was one of our first times seeing something so baffling and of poor quality. There were a lot of bad flash games we played, some arguably worse than Nazi Clowns (WIP), but they aren’t always funny. And Nazi Clowns (WIP) hits a good balance of being terrible, but still kind of funny without being too long or annoying. I’m intentionally keeping things vague, as there isn’t much to talk about with this game outside of describing it, and I’m trying to throw Sam a bit of a bone. I’ll let him give you the rundown of the nitty gritty details of Nazi Clowns(WIP). 

Though, I’m still not over the fact that the soundtrack is a hard rock version of Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. 

Happy Bar “Mitzfah”!
