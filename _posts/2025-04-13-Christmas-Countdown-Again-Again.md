## Skeeter's Take:

I’ll concede that I did pick Christmas Countdown again purely for the meme and the shitpost potential, but damn, did I feel all warm and fuzzy seeing the shitty background I drew on Day 220 when I loaded this back up.

Between Sam trying to bug fix their game and them actually responding and working on the game, and them using my bad MS paint background, MilkmanisSad made this one of the most memorable reviews for me. Just looking back in retrospect, it’s funny to think a game that counts down to Christmas would make this much of an impression on me, and yet, here I am bringing it back around on day 348. I will probably never forget Christmas Countdown, and I think MilkmanIsSad is the main reason why. 

I can’t wait for this project to end so I can review Christmas Countdown every day for a year. 

**Recommend: YES**

**Replay Percentage Chance: CHRISTMAS COUNTDOWN INFINITY**

**Time Played: I NEVER STOPPED**

Did... did they manually reset the timer so it could countdown to next Christmas?

Will they have to update it again on Dec 26, 2025?

This game is so fucking good.


**Recommend: IT’S THE CHRISTMAS COUNTDOWN**

**Replay Percentage Chance: BEEEDOODEEEEDOOOOO**

**Time Played: BEDUDEDEDOOOO**
