## Sam's Take:

This seems to be someone’s unfinished RPG maker project. You play a lil dragon who is going to transform into a human then move to a new village and needs to pack up his stuff for the trip. Your buddy Kett says you’ll need a blade, something to cover yourself, and 9 scales before you go.

Well I got those things, but it seems my progression is blocked:

The author makes it pretty clear that this isn’t a finished piece, so maybe this is as far as they got.

Honestly, they wrote some characters that have personality, they implied a world bigger than what we see in the game, it’s not a bad start. Obviously it’s unfinished, and it does not look great, but the idea of a dragon living among humans after seeing their bones scattered around their cave is a cute idea. You could go the “dragon learns humans are neat and doesn’t want to kill them anymore” route. You could go full cutesy murder for slasher-comedy purposes. This isn’t the worst intro to a game I’ve seen.

I don’t recommend you play some young dev’s unfinished RPG maker project, but I do dec are this dev “not hopeless”. Big congrats.

## Skeeter's Take:

Sam is in Ohio, jet-lagged as all hell. and probably fell asleep before Skeeter posted his review.

Sam will update this once he wakes up tomorrow.
