## Sam's Take:

This seems to be someone’s unfinished RPG maker project. You play a lil dragon who is going to transform into a human then move to a new village and needs to pack up his stuff for the trip. Your buddy Kett says you’ll need a blade, something to cover yourself, and 9 scales before you go.

Well I got those things, but it seems my progression is blocked:

The author makes it pretty clear that this isn’t a finished piece, so maybe this is as far as they got.

Honestly, they wrote some characters that have personality, they implied a world bigger than what we see in the game, it’s not a bad start. Obviously it’s unfinished, and it does not look great, but the idea of a dragon living among humans after seeing their bones scattered around their cave is a cute idea. You could go the “dragon learns humans are neat and doesn’t want to kill them anymore” route. You could go full cutesy murder for slasher-comedy purposes. This isn’t the worst intro to a game I’ve seen.

I don’t recommend you play some young dev’s unfinished RPG maker project, but I do declare this dev “not hopeless”. Big congrats.

## Skeeter's Take:

Pack Dragon has some rough art that I really enjoy:

I much prefer this to some pre-made assets that look nice, but often make the games that use them feel “samey” (see any of the PS1 inspired horror games we’ve played recently). Sure, it might not look the best, technically speaking, but this shows the dev put the time in to make this game look unique. It’s like when a kid draws you a picture. You might not be able to tell exactly what you’re looking at, but you are happy because they tried their best and made something for you. 

Same goes with the rest of this game. There’s a clear effort put in, but this isn’t finished. Also, it’s just personal taste, but I found myself really bored. I think it’s something about RPG Maker games that gives me an instant distaste. I hope the dev continues to work on games. 

**Recommend: No**
