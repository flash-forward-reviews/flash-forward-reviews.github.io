## Skeeter's Take:

ShrumShooter is a simple little Galaga-like shooter. Garlic heads will fall down from the top of the screen and the player needs to control their ship to shoot the falling garlic and earn coins. If their ship makes contact with a garlic, they lose a life.

This is actually an assumption of how the gameplay is supposed to go since I couldn’t actually figure out how to control or move the ship or even shoot. 

If you figure out how to control the ship, you can message me at iamsamcain@gmail.com and I’ll give you a dollar. 

**Recommend: NO**

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 30 seconds**

## Sam's Take:

I love a good review where Skeeter can’t figure something out, then I come in and make fun of him... but alas I too could not figure out how to play this game.

I think I pressed every button on my keyboard and mouse. Nothing doing. Tried dragging the ship, scroll wheelin’. Todd Howard must hate this game, because it just doesn’t work.

Also I think I’m cutting [Etali, Primal Conqueror](https://scryfall.com/card/mom/137/etali-primal-conqueror-etali-primal-sickness){:target="_blank"} from my commander cube. It’s just too abusive in commander draft, where the decks aren’t quite tuned enough to go off before you’re able to cast it. Also I forgot you can have it as your commander. I’m also watching the number of board wipes. It felt like too many today, but I don’t want to base too much off of one game.

**Recommend: My cube is for sure tuned for more players, but I think I can make it work for 4-6 if I cut an archetype, or get a few more cards that overlap.** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: Cube? 100% obviously.**

**Time Played: Sorry if you don’t play magic and none of this means anything to you.**
