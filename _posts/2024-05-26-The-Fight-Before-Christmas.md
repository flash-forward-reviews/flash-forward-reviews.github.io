## Skeeter's Take:

I have a feeling The Fight Before Christmas is what all those news stations were referring to when they talked about the “War on Christmas”. 

Glossing over the fact that Jesus opted for his crucifixion cross as a weapon, he just feels so weak in comparison to the Almighty Santa.

Firstly, Santa can block attacks - I do not think Jesus has the same ability, so you end up standing there swinging your crucifixion cross at this pointy-hat weirdo and he blocks it with a candy cane.

I also picked Santa, and I still couldn’t figure out how to block, but that doesn’t matter - Jesus still can’t block as an AI, and you do way more damage with your peppermint stick as Santa. 
9/10 times, Santa wins this match up. I did manage to beat Santa as Jesus by constantly backing up just out of his swing range and smacking him, but overall, the Santa/Jesus imbalance is crazy. 

I’m sure this is just a meta commentary on how consumerism is killing religion and not some horribly unbalanced game. 

Merry Christmas!

## Sam's Take:

Yo Skeeter, right click is block:

It’s also dodge for Jesus, but it seems to just make his animation stop and he teleports backwards one centimeter.

But ignoring the fact that Skeeter doesn’t know how to read, he is correct about the capitalism destroying religion angle of this game. If you win as Santa you get this win screen:

If you win as Jesus you get this:

This was made in 3 days for a game jam. I checked the page for this jam, and unfortunately A Fight Before Christmas did not win any awards. This Tail of Ratsmas game kinda swept up the whole thing though:

So I played the shit out of Ratsmus.

So I guess in the end this game is net-neutral. It’s not very good, but it led us to another game we can review later.

Why am I so mean to these games, but give [Pig](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-4){:target="_blank"} a pass? I think it’s because Pig is weird and adorable. It’s not trying to have edgy humor, or say “I’m a big ol shitpost lol”, Pig just is. Jesus vs Santa is a comic idea I would have in 6th grade, and I hate 6th grade me more than anyone else on this planet.
