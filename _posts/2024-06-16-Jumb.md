## Sam's Take:

I’ll let my boy [Aladdin203](https://aladdin203.itch.io/){:target="_blank"} take the explanation for me:

Got it? Great. Get to bouncing that block and not hitting the cells or ground. If you do it, the timer goes away and nothing else changes. It just keeps going until you hit the ground or the cells and you get a game over. Not [Aladdin’s best work](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-25){:target="_blank"}, but it does have sick lighting:

RTX ON!

## Skeeter's Take:

Jump or Jumb?

Anyway, this is just [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird){:target="_blank"} without a bird or forward movement.

**Recommend: Back to playing Space with all my 2 friends.** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: 0%**

**Time Played: 80 seconds (so close)**
