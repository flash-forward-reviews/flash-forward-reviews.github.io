## Sam's Take:

The description is in Spanish (I think), but there’s a YouTube link to a video tutorial on how to code the joker slots in Balatro (selecting a card, changing the order around, etc).

So some guy followed a video tutorial and got it to kind of work, but it’s off center and the cards move VERY slowly. We’ve said many times that we are just reviewing people learning to make games, but this is the only time I’ve seen a tutorial in the description. There is no reason to review this.

Also I do not speak Spanish. I am glad the cards say “JAMMO” though. That’s very good.

Jammo? More like Jammo a nail into my eye and complete the half-lobotomy the doctor gave me at birth, amirite? 

I’m running out of material.
