## Skeeter's Take:

I’m still getting over the name “Scare Girl”. It’s so simple, plain, yet really really funny. 
In Scare Girl (lol), the player runs around a dark map with random halloween props and random vases scattered throughout the area. The player's goal is to collect 10 treasure chests and “Open the door” to win (whatever that means). Sometimes, Jason Voorhees, A glowing-eyed rabbit mascot, or a Scare Girl will run at you and jump scare you (at which I laughed every single time it happened). Occasionally, there are real enemies you have to avoid, like a giant T-Rex. 
It’s a surreal landscape filled with what seem to be various free assets, which I’m not here to judge, but it’s hard to notice none of the models fit together stylistically. 

None of this really matters though, because what really matters is that Scare Girl won my heart with a single, non-looping 1:17 second banger of a song from Level 4. This song is as hilarious as it is unintentionally unnerving. The way it interweaves with the players delayed footsteps (that sound suspiciously themselves like a midi percussion instrument) to make the absolute worst “polyrhythm” I’ve ever heard is just *chefs kiss*. No amount of word explaining could ever do this track justice, so I’ve provided a sample below (you can thank me later):

Sorry for the T-Rex jumpscare. You’ll notice early in the video I just walked by the dinosaur, but as soon as I hit “Stop” on my recording software, that lizard bastard thought that was the perfect time to kill me dead. I managed to start recording again just in time to catch the end of the “death cutscene”, and found the footage essential to this review. 

Level 4 - thank you for the hardest laugh I’ve had in a while. 

**Recommend: Load Level 4. Listen for 1:17 min. Exit. Repeat.**

## Sam's Take:

Everything about Scare Girl is a fucking masterpiece. The way the flashlight just lights the floor directly beneath you, the way your footsteps sound like a Transformers sequel, the way the music tracks all stop instead of looping, further exasperating the footstep-autobot issue. 

Like look at this screenshot:

First of all, ghost funny, we all agree on that. Second, gotta love the efficiency of having the controls on the screen at all times. Third, in the bottom left they count the number of chests, but they couldn’t put a space between “chest” and “0”. There are zero things right with this game. Even the developer’s comments on Steam are fucking unhinged:

QUICK NEWS I’LL DELETE THIS GAME IF I LOSE IT BUT I WON’T BECAUSE IT’S IN TWO PLACES ALSO I WENT TO A FRIEND’S AND PLAYED LFD2 SO I’M KINDA BUSY RIGHT NOW!

We haven’t even explored the zombie mode, then right when I was about to quit, I discovered an invite system... this game has multiplayer...

And a sequel...

It’s gunna be a good week.
