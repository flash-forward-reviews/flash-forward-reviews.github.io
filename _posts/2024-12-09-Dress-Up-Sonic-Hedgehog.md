## Skeeter's Take:

Dress Up Sonic Hedgehog is another run-of-the-mill Newgrounds dress-up game from the early 2000s. You drag and drop clothes onto Sonic. I’m sure if you’ve played a dress-up game before, I don’t need to explain anything else to you.

I picked this game, despite us playing numerous dress up games between this project and the last, only because of the description from the dev.

The dev is playing some hard defense here. NOT GAY AND I DON’T LIKE SONIC. WHY IS EVERYONE SAYING I HAVE A CRUSH ON SONIC. I DON’T. I TOTALLY DON’T LOVE BLUE CARTOON HEDGEHOGS GET OFF MY CASE GUYS, JEEZE. 

My friend. If all this is true, why did you give us the option to put Sonic in a pink shirt that reads “Sexy Hog”?

This was 19 years ago. I like to think Scothu has come to terms with their budding Sonic sexual preference. 

It’s ok, man. There are worse things out there than having a crush on Sonic. 

Like Sonic Fart Porn (I’d like to “thank” Sam for introducing me to the SFP horrors of the internet.) 

**Recommend: No!**

**Replay Percentage Chance: Fuck No!**

**Time Played: 1 minutes or something**

## Sam's Take:

I'm not gay, but I am a Newgrounds fan. I've made this clear in the past. One thing I am not is a fanboy so I enjoy seeing Newgrounds in unusual situations. Including this, since its unusual to see it dress up Sonic. If I were to make this a dirty review like all you think/want it to be, I would have reviewed a penis. Did I? No. Plus you dont have to play anything you dont want to.

**Recommend: He's** 

**Replay Percentage Chance: Not**

**Time Played: Gay**
