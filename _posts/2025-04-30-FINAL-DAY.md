## Skeeter's Take:

I don’t understand this game at all, for one thing, this is the menu screen of which the background seems to be ripped directly from newgrounds.

There is a two instrument, two note, one high-hat loop constantly playing in the background. It drives me to madness. 

None of the episodes or difficulties make any sense. Just look at the difficulty settings here and tell me you can understand these:

The first level starts with that meme “Giant Enemy Crab” song. The textures hurt my eyes. It seems to mostly be normal doom otherwise, but just look at this wall texture:

Once I saw this ugly-ass Roblox character running at me, I knew it was over.

Nothing about this mod makes any sense, none of it works. Most of the assets seem to have been ripped directly from other games and assembled together with no rhyme or reason. It’s chaos, but the kind of chaos I don’t wish to partake in. 

I’d rather be playing [Monkey Business](https://flash-forward-reviews.github.io/day-71){:target="_blank"}
