## Skeeter's Take:

Well, I can’t really fault “Bad Game” for being bad. It’s right there on the tin: “Bad Game”. The dev knows it’s bad, and the game itself almost boasts its own terribleness by wearing its title of Bad Game proudly. I can really only blame myself for clicking on a game titled “Bad Game”, but here we are. 

Here’s how Bad Game starts:

If you are asking, “what the hell am I looking at?” that’s a good instinct. It does not get better as time goes on. If you look closely, you’ll see an image of the Prince from the Katamari Series with the hair of Midoriya from My Hero Academia badly cropped on his head. This is what the player controls. I think the goal is to collect the blonde hair man with the upside down teeth, but I never managed to accomplish this because the game periodically fades to the following terrible image - you can still click out of this review by the way. There’s nothing keeping you. And there’s really no reason to filthy your eyes with the image I was cursed to look upon. There should be an “X” on the top right of your browser window if you are reading on PC. I suggest you click that instead of traveling further.

I think this is a Pokemon trainer from one of the Gens I skipped (either X + Y or Sword + Shield). They are sticking their fucking disgusting dirty foot in my face and I absolutely hate it. I hate it because it’s disgusting and gross, but also because I can’t overlook the foot fetish overtones of this photo that adds to my discomfort. Like feet on your own time, don’t literally shove it unwillingly into my face! This fucking abomination will show up every 10 or so seconds, completely block out the play area of the screen, and then when the game finally fades back to the play area, your little controllable image of Price Midoriya completely disappears, making this game wholly unfunctional (not that it really was functional prior). 

I naively thought it couldn't get worse than what I had already experienced, but I noticed the yellow haired dude kept multiplying and after every miasmic foot jumpscare, there would be significantly more blonde dudes. This eventually reached a point where my game could no longer function and forced the game to crash.

This game isn’t just “bad”. It’s non-functional and deplorable. Keep your dirty piggies out of my fucking face, thank you. 

**Recommend: NO FUCK THIS. I HATE THIS. (if you are a dirty foot fetishist your traction may vary)**

**Replay Percentage Chance: LMAOLMAO LMAO LMAO NO NO LMAO LMAO**

**Time Played: 30 seconds**
