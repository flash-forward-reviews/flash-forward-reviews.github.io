Eons ago, Skeeter and Sam reviewed a flash game every day for a year, comparing each game to the hit Children's MMO Club Penguin. Now that both Flash and Club Penguin are dead, Skeeter and Sam are back to try out new games and see which ones will stand the test of time.

Theoretically there are rules, but they might change as time goes on. Right now we pick a game, play it for as long (or short) as we want. After that, we decide if we recommend it, and what the chances of us reviewing it again later are.
