Eons ago, Skeeter and Sam reviewed a flash game every day for a year, comparing each game to the hit Children's MMO Club Penguin. Now that both Flash and Club Penguin are dead, Skeeter and Sam are back to try out new games and see which ones will stand the test of time.

Theoretically there are rules, but we don't know what they are yet. We are allowed to play games for multiple days, but for no more than thirty minutes a day. We will recommend each game based on how long we played it and if we'd like to play it more. This will hopefully become more defined as the year progresses, and then we will update this to make sense.
